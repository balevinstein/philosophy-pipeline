Example Development\n- Select diverse, well-documented cases\n- Provide detailed analysis showing clear integration\n- Anticipate and address potential counterarguments\n\n4. Literature Integration\n- Explicitly connect to existing hybrid discussions\n- Show advancement beyond current frameworks\n- Demonstrate practical utility improvement\n\nThe move appears feasible with careful attention to these elements. Success depends on maintaining theoretical clarity while demonstrating practical utility. The key risks are manageable through careful implementation and strong example development. The approach should strengthen rather than weaken the framework by showing its sophistication in handling complex cases.\n\nWould you like me to elaborate on any aspect of this analysis?"
