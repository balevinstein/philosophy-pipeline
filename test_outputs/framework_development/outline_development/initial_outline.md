Final Outline

## 1. Introduction
- Frame the problem: methodological confusion in debates about conceptual analysis
- Preview novel framework distinguishing descriptive/revisionary approaches
- State thesis and roadmap
- Note significance for both theory and practice

## 2. Foundations and Framework
### 2.1 Types of Conceptual Analysis
- Characterize descriptive vs revisionary approaches
