# Scratch Work
- Strong core framework with logical progression
- Section 2 may be too broad for word count
- Good alignment between abstract/thesis and section development
- Potential compression needed in validation section
- Literature engagement concentrated in early sections
- Case study approach needs careful scoping

# Framework Alignment Analysis
- Strong support for key moves in sections 3 and 4
- Abstract elements well-distributed across sections
- Core concepts receive dedicated treatment in 3.1-3.3
- Methodology development centered appropriately in section 3
- Main claims supported through progressive development
+ Framework development logically structured
- Could strengthen connection between objectives and methods in 3.3

# Structural Analysis
+ Clear progression from problem to solution to validation
+ Good balance between theoretical and practical elements
- Section 2 may introduce too many elements before framework
+ Strong argument building through sections 3-5
+ Appropriate treatment of objections in section 5
- Validation section could be more focused
+ Hybrid approaches well-positioned after main framework

# Feasibility Assessment
- Section 2 likely requires 1000+ words as structured
+ Framework development (Section 3) appropriately sized
- Validation section potentially too elaborate
+ Case study approach feasible if tightly scoped
- May need to compress theoretical assessment
Estimated section allocations:
- Introduction: 500
- Section 2: 1000
- Section 3: 1500
- Section 4: 500
- Section 5: 300
- Conclusion: 200

# Literature Integration
+ Good use of Quinean challenges in section 2
+ Chalmers/Jackson methodology informing section 3
- Could strengthen literature engagement in framework development
+ Available sources support key theoretical moves
- May need more selective use of literature in section 2

# Red Flags
! Section 2 scope exceeds word count constraints
! Validation section risks diverting space from core framework
! Literature support thin for some framework elements
! Case study needs very careful scoping
! Some framework elements lack explicit literature grounding

# Specific Recommendations
1. Compress section 2 by:
   - Focusing specifically on methodological challenges
   - Moving some content to framework development
   - Tightening literature engagement

2. Streamline validation approach:
   - Combine theoretical assessment with case study
   - Focus on specific methodological insights
   - Reduce scope of counterexample treatment

3. Strengthen framework development:
   - Add explicit connection to literature in 3.1
   - Enhance methodology selection principles
   - Tighten success criteria presentation

4. Improve structural flow:
   - Create clearer transitions between sections
   - Strengthen connections between objectives and methods
   - Better integrate literature throughout

# Summary Assessment
MINOR REFINEMENT

The outline provides a strong foundation but needs targeted adjustments to:
- Improve feasibility within word count
- Strengthen literature integration
- Focus validation approach
- Tighten theoretical development

The core structure is sound and supports framework development well. Recommended changes will enhance rather than fundamentally alter the approach. Key strengths include logical progression, balanced treatment of theory and practice, and appropriate positioning of framework elements.

Primary focus should be on compressing section 2 and streamlining validation while maintaining strong framework development in section 3. These adjustments will improve feasibility while preserving essential argument structure.
