# Scratch Work
- Section 2 compression critical for word count feasibility
- Validation approach can be streamlined without losing key insights
- Literature engagement needs better distribution
- Framework development (Section 3) remains priority
- Must maintain clear progression supporting thesis
- Case study needs tight focus on methodological confusion

# Framework Support Analysis
Main Thesis Support:
- Compressed Section 2 allows more space for framework development
- Enhanced literature integration strengthens theoretical foundation
- Streamlined validation maintains evidence while reducing overhead
- Better connection between objectives and methods in Section 3

Core Contribution Support:
- More focused treatment of challenges
- Stronger theoretical grounding through distributed literature
- Clearer practical methodology development
- More efficient validation approach

Key Moves Support:
- Better space allocation for success criteria development
- Improved theoretical foundation through literature integration
- More focused case study approach
- Clearer treatment of hybrid approaches

Literature Engagement:
- Better distribution throughout framework development
- More selective use in challenge discussion
- Stronger theoretical grounding
- More efficient integration

# Refinement Decisions
## Will Implement
1. Compress Section 2:
   - Focus specifically on methodological challenges
   - Move theoretical background into framework development
   - Streamline literature review
   Rationale: Essential for word count feasibility while maintaining key content

2. Restructure Validation:
   - Combine theoretical assessment with case study
   - Focus on specific methodological insights
   - Integrate literature support more efficiently
   Rationale: More efficient validation without losing key insights

3. Enhance Framework Development:
   - Add explicit literature connections
   - Strengthen methodology selection principles
   - Better integrate theoretical background
   Rationale: Strengthens core contribution while maintaining clarity

4. Improve Literature Integration:
   - Distribute engagement throughout sections
   - Focus on key theoretical supports
   - Better connect to framework elements
   Rationale: Stronger theoretical grounding without excessive space

## Won't Implement
1. Extensive case studies
   Reason: Word count constraints require focused approach

2. Separate theoretical assessment section
   Reason: More efficient to integrate with case study
