# Scratch Work
- Strong conceptual foundation with clear thesis and moves
- Section 3 seems dense given word limit constraints
- Literature engagement concentrated in section 2, may need broader distribution
- Validation approach in section 4 needs clearer connection to framework elements
- Success criteria development requires careful space management
- Good balance of theoretical and practical elements
- Clear progression from problem to solution to validation

# Framework Alignment Analysis
+ Sections support key moves through logical progression
+ Abstract elements well-distributed across sections
+ Core concepts receive dedicated development space
- Success criteria section may need more granular structure
+ Main claims have clear development paths
- Selection principles may need more explicit connection to literature

# Structural Analysis
+ Clear logical flow from problem to solution
+ Good balance between theoretical and practical elements
- Section 3 subsections may be too densely packed
+ Effective buildup of framework components
+ Appropriate placement of objections/counterexamples
- May need earlier introduction of some key concepts

# Feasibility Assessment
Section estimates for 4000 words:
- Introduction: ~500 words
- Methodological Challenges: ~750 words
- Framework Development: ~1500 words
- Framework Validation: ~800 words
- Conclusion: ~450 words

Concerns:
- Framework Development section likely too ambitious
- Validation section needs tighter focus
- May need to reduce theoretical background scope

# Literature Integration
+ Good use of Quinean challenges in section 2
+ Chalmers/Jackson insights inform framework development
- Could better distribute literature engagement across sections
- May need more explicit connections to application conditionals
+ Effective handling of analyticity concerns

# Red Flags
! Section 3 too dense for word limit
! Literature support thin for selection principles
! Case study approach needs tighter specification
! Success criteria development may require more space
! Theoretical foundations may need streamlining

# Specific Recommendations
1. Split Section 3 into two main sections:
   - Theoretical Foundations & Success Criteria
   - Selection Principles & Applications

2. Integrate literature more throughout:
   - Connect selection principles to Chalmers/Jackson
   - Use application conditionals in success criteria
   - Address Quinean concerns throughout

3. Tighten validation approach:
   - Focus on one clear case study
   - Explicit connection to framework elements
   - Streamline counterexample treatment

4. Strengthen theoretical development:
   - Earlier introduction of key concepts
   - More explicit literature connections
   - Clearer progression to selection principles

5. Adjust proportions:
   - Reduce theoretical background
   - Expand success criteria development
   - Tighten validation section

# Summary Assessment
MINOR REFINEMENT

The outline provides a strong foundation but needs some structural adjustments to better support framework development within word constraints. Key recommendations focus on redistributing Section 3 content, strengthening literature integration, and tightening the validation approach. These changes will improve feasibility while maintaining the strong conceptual foundation and logical progression.

The core structure is sound, but refinements will enhance development space for key elements while ensuring appropriate literature engagement and maintaining feasibility within the word limit. The suggested adjustments preserve the essential framework while creating better conditions for detailed development.
