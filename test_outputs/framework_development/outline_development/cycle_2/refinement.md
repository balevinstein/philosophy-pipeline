# Scratch Work
- Section 3 splitting creates better development space while maintaining logical flow
- Literature integration needs strategic distribution without diluting key sections
- Case study focus will strengthen validation while reducing space needs
- Success criteria require careful balancing of theoretical/practical elements
- Selection principles need explicit grounding in literature
- Word count constraints suggest focusing theoretical background

# Framework Support Analysis
Main Thesis Support:
- Split framework sections better develop methodological distinctions
- Earlier concept introduction strengthens theoretical foundation
- Distributed literature engagement reinforces key claims
- Tighter validation approach demonstrates practical application

Core Contribution:
- Clearer progression through framework elements
- Better space allocation for success criteria development
- Stronger connection between theory and practice
- More explicit literature grounding

Key Moves:
- Earlier introduction supports establishing criteria
- Better literature distribution strengthens selection principles
- Focused case study demonstrates framework application
- Hybrid approaches receive appropriate attention

# Refinement Decisions
## Will Implement
1. Split Section 3 into:
   - "Theoretical Foundations and Success Criteria"
   - "Selection Principles and Applications"
   Rationale: Better development space, clearer progression

2. Integrate literature throughout:
   - Connect Quinean challenges to specific criteria
   - Use application conditionals in success criteria
   Rationale: Stronger theoretical grounding

3. Focus validation on single case study
   Rationale: Deeper analysis within word constraints

4. Earlier introduction of key concepts
   Rationale: Better supports theoretical development

## Won't Implement
1. Extensive reduction of theoretical background
   Reason: Essential for framework credibility

2. Major restructuring of success criteria
   Reason: Current structure effectively supports development
