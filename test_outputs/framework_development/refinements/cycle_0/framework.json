    "abstract": "Contemporary debates about conceptual analysis often focus on its general validity while overlooking important methodological differences between distinct types of analysis. Building on existing work in application conditionals and addressing Quinean challenges to analyticity, this paper develops a novel framework distinguishing descriptive from revisionary conceptual analysis based on their primary aims and success criteria. Descriptive analysis seeks to capture existing usage and intuitions, while revisionary analysis prioritizes theoretical utility and precision. Through examination of case studies and methodological debates, I demonstrate how this distinction illuminates persistent disagreements about proper analytical methodology. The framework provides clear criteria for selecting between descriptive and revisionary approaches based on specific philosophical objectives, while showing how apparent counterexamples often represent sophisticated hybrid cases rather than taxonomy failures. This analysis advances both our theoretical understanding of conceptual analysis and provides practical methodological guidance.",
    "main_thesis": "Different types of conceptual analysis can be distinguished based on their methodological commitments and success criteria: descriptive analysis prioritizes capturing existing usage and intuitions, while revisionary analysis prioritizes theoretical utility and precision, with each type requiring distinct evaluative approaches.",
    "core_contribution": "The paper provides a systematic framework for distinguishing between descriptive and revisionary conceptual analysis through clear success criteria and methodological principles, while offering practical guidance for methodology selection in philosophical research.",

    "development_notes": "Refinements strengthen theoretical foundations through explicit engagement with application conditionals and Quinean challenges while maintaining practical focus. Success criteria are now more central to the framework, providing clear evaluative tools. The core descriptive/revisionary distinction remains primary while acknowledging hybrid complexity. Changes maintain feasibility within word limit while adding methodological sophistication.",
