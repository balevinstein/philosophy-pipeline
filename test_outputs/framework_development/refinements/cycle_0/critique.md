# Scratch Work
The framework shows strong potential with clear alignment between components. Key strengths include practical focus, engagement with fundamental challenges, and clear development path. Main areas for refinement include tightening the connection to literature and clarifying methodological distinctions.

# Abstract Analysis
Generally strong with clear problem statement and contribution. 

Strengths:
- Clear identification of gap and contribution
- Good balance of theoretical/practical elements
- Effective preview of argument structure

Areas for refinement:
- Could more explicitly position relative to Quinean challenges
- Consider mentioning application conditionals as methodological tool
- Strengthen connection to existing literature on conceptual analysis

# Framework Components Analysis
## Main Thesis
Strong overall with clear distinction between analysis types.

Strengths:
- Clear methodological focus
- Practical distinction between approaches
- Testable claims

Refinements needed:
- More explicit connection to semantic holism concerns
- Clarify relationship between success criteria and methodological commitments

## Core Contribution
Well-aligned with thesis and abstract.

Strengths:
- Clear practical value
- Theoretical sophistication
- Actionable guidance

Refinements needed:
- Emphasize novelty in handling hybrid cases
- Strengthen connection to existing frameworks

## Key Moves
Logical progression with feasible development path.

Strengths:
- Building sequence of arguments
- Clear practical examples
- Addresses counterexamples

Refinements needed:
- Add explicit engagement with Chalmers/Jackson's application conditionals
- Consider expanding hybrid cases discussion
- More detail on success criteria development

## Development Notes
Generally feasible within constraints.

Strengths:
- Clear development path
- Realistic scope
- Strong literature engagement

Challenges:
- Balancing theoretical depth with practical utility
- Managing complex case studies within word limit
- Maintaining clear distinctions while acknowledging holism

# Validation Assessment
- Scope appropriate: YES - focused problem with clear boundaries
- Clearly articulated: YES - clear thesis and development path
- Sufficiently original: YES - novel framework with clear contribution
- Feasibly developable: YES - realistic within constraints

# Improvement Recommendations
1. Abstract:
- Add explicit mention of handling Quinean challenges
- Reference application conditionals methodology
- Strengthen literature positioning

2. Framework:
- Develop explicit success criteria earlier
- Expand hybrid cases discussion
- Add specific methodology for distinguishing types

3. Development:
- Create decision tree for approach selection
- Develop clear criteria for hybrid classification
- Add specific examples of success criteria

# Summary Assessment
MINOR REFINEMENT

The framework is fundamentally sound with clear alignment between components. Suggested refinements focus on strengthening theoretical foundations and practical applications while maintaining the core structure. The balance between theoretical sophistication and practical utility is particularly strong, though could be enhanced through more explicit engagement with key literature concepts.

Key strengths to preserve:
- Clear practical/theoretical balance
- Strong development pathway
- Effective handling of potential objections

Focus refinements on:
- Stronger literature integration
- Clearer methodological distinctions
- More explicit success criteria

Overall, the framework shows strong potential with clear development path and meaningful contribution to the field.
