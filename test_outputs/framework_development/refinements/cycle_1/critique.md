# Scratch Work
The framework shows promising integration of theoretical sophistication with practical application. Key strengths include clear methodology focus and explicit engagement with major challenges. Main areas for attention include success criteria specification and case study integration.

# Abstract Analysis
- Clarity: Strong overall, clear progression from problem to solution
- Engagement: Effectively signals relevance to ongoing debates
- Literature positioning: Good reference to key concepts but could more explicitly frame contribution
- Key claims: Well-structured but success criteria could be more specific

Strengths:
- Clear distinction between analysis types
- Strong integration of theoretical foundations
- Effective signaling of practical relevance

Areas for improvement:
- More specific preview of success criteria
- Clearer articulation of framework's unique contribution
- Stronger connection to existing methodological debates

# Framework Components Analysis
## Main Thesis
Strong core formulation but could be more precise about success criteria differentiation.

Suggested refinement:
"Different types of conceptual analysis can be distinguished through specific methodological commitments and success criteria: descriptive analysis evaluates concepts against established linguistic practices and shared intuitions, while revisionary analysis prioritizes theoretical precision and explanatory utility, with each type requiring distinct evaluative frameworks."

## Core Contribution
Generally clear but could better emphasize methodological innovation.

Suggested refinement:
"The paper develops a systematic framework that both distinguishes between descriptive and revisionary conceptual analysis through explicit success criteria and provides practical methodology selection principles, advancing both theoretical understanding and research practice."

## Key Moves
Generally feasible but could better specify progression.

Suggested refinements:
1. "Establish distinct success criteria through analysis of paradigm cases"
2. "Develop systematic methodology selection principles"
3. "Demonstrate framework application through focused case studies"
4. "Address potential objections through hybrid case analysis"

## Development Notes
Generally realistic but could better specify resource requirements.

Suggested additions:
- Specify case study selection criteria
- Detail success criteria development process
- Outline hybrid case identification method

# Validation Assessment
- Scope appropriate: YES - focused contribution within word limit
- Clearly articulated: YES - clear progression and claims
- Sufficiently original: YES - novel framework with practical application
- Feasibly developable: YES - realistic scope with clear development path

# Improvement Recommendations
1. Abstract:
- Add specific example of success criteria
- Strengthen contribution statement
- Better preview methodology

2. Framework:
- More explicit success criteria specification
- Clearer case study selection principles
- Better integration of hybrid approaches

3. Development:
- Add specific resource requirements
- Outline case study methodology
- Detail success criteria development process

# Summary Assessment
MINOR REFINEMENT

The framework is fundamentally sound with good integration of components. Suggested refinements focus on making success criteria more explicit and strengthening methodological specificity while maintaining the current effective structure.

Key strengths to preserve:
- Clear theoretical/practical balance
- Strong engagement with literature
- Feasible scope and development path

Focus refinements on:
- Success criteria specification
- Methodological detail
- Case study integration

The framework shows strong potential for developing a valuable contribution to conceptual analysis methodology while remaining feasible within constraints.
