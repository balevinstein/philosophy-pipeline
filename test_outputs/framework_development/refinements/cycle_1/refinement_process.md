# Scratch Work
Key considerations from critique analysis:
- Success criteria specification valuable but must remain feasible
- Methodological detail important while maintaining scope
- Case study approach needs clear parameters
- Abstract suggestions valuable but must maintain word count
- Thesis refinement suggestion adds useful precision
- Core contribution revision maintains strengths while adding clarity

Integration assessment:
- Success criteria can be better specified without expansion
- Case study approach can be clarified through key moves
- Abstract can incorporate stronger methodology preview
- Components remain aligned through careful refinement

# Refinement Decisions
Will implement:
- Refined thesis with more precise success criteria differentiation
- Strengthened core contribution emphasizing methodology
- More specific key moves for case studies
- Enhanced abstract methodology preview
- Clearer success criteria specification

Won't implement:
- Detailed case study selection criteria (too granular for scope)
- Extensive hybrid case methodology (risks overcomplicating)
- Resource requirement details (unnecessary for framework)

# Framework Components

## Abstract
Contemporary debates about conceptual analysis often focus on its general validity while overlooking important methodological differences between distinct types of analysis. Building on existing work in application conditionals and addressing Quinean challenges to analyticity, this paper develops a novel framework distinguishing descriptive from revisionary conceptual analysis through systematic evaluation criteria. Descriptive analysis evaluates concepts against established linguistic practices and shared intuitions, while revisionary analysis prioritizes theoretical utility and explanatory power. Through examination of paradigm cases and methodological debates, I demonstrate how this distinction illuminates persistent disagreements about proper analytical methodology. The framework provides clear principles for selecting between descriptive and revisionary approaches based on specific philosophical objectives, while showing how apparent counterexamples often represent sophisticated hybrid cases rather than taxonomy failures. This analysis advances both our theoretical understanding of conceptual analysis and provides practical methodological guidance.

## Main Thesis
Different types of conceptual analysis can be distinguished through specific methodological commitments and success criteria: descriptive analysis evaluates concepts against established linguistic practices and shared intuitions, while revisionary analysis prioritizes theoretical precision and explanatory utility, with each type requiring distinct evaluative frameworks.

## Core Contribution
The paper develops a systematic framework that both distinguishes between descriptive and revisionary conceptual analysis through explicit success criteria and provides practical methodology selection principles, advancing both theoretical understanding and research practice.

## Key Moves
- Establish distinct success criteria through analysis of paradigm cases in conceptual analysis literature
- Develop systematic methodology selection principles based on philosophical objectives
- Demonstrate framework application through focused case studies of historical debates
- Address potential objections through analysis of apparent counterexamples and hybrid approaches

## Development Notes
Refinements strengthen methodological precision while maintaining feasible scope. Success criteria now more explicitly tied to paradigm cases and philosophical objectives. Abstract better previews methodology while maintaining word count. Case study approach clarified through key moves without overcomplicating framework. Changes preserve theoretical sophistication while enhancing practical applicability.
