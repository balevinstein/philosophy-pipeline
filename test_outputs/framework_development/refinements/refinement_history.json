This paper develops a novel framework distinguishing descriptive from revisionary conceptual analysis based on their primary aims and success criteria. Descriptive analysis seeks to capture existing usage and intuitions, while revisionary analysis prioritizes theoretical utility and precision. Through detailed examination of case studies and historical debates, I demonstrate how this distinction illuminates persistent disagreements about proper analytical methodology.
