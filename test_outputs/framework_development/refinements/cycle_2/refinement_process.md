# Scratch Work
Key considerations:
- Critique highlights need for concrete success criteria without overcomplicating
- Case study scope needs careful focus while maintaining demonstrative power
- Hybrid cases require better setup but remain important to framework
- Abstract improvements should preserve strong elements while enhancing clarity
- Word count constraints require strategic decisions about additions

Main integration challenges:
- Balancing concrete criteria with theoretical sophistication
- Maintaining coherence while adding specificity
- Preserving scope feasibility with tighter focus

# Refinement Decisions
Will implement:
- More explicit success criteria in abstract and thesis
- Tighter specification of case study approach
- Clearer setup for hybrid cases in abstract
- Stronger connection between theoretical and practical elements

Won't implement:
- Adding concrete example to abstract (would exceed word limit/dilute focus)
- Expanding hybrid case taxonomy (scope constraint)
- Major restructuring of key moves (current progression works well)

# Framework Components

## Abstract
Contemporary debates about conceptual analysis often focus on its general validity while overlooking important methodological differences between distinct types of analysis. This paper develops a novel framework distinguishing descriptive from revisionary conceptual analysis through systematic evaluation criteria: descriptive analysis requires consistency with established usage and robust intuitive support, while revisionary analysis demands theoretical precision and demonstrated explanatory gains. Building on work in application conditionals and addressing Quinean challenges to analyticity, I demonstrate how selecting between approaches depends on specific philosophical objectives - whether clarifying existing concepts or engineering improved ones. The framework reveals how many apparent counterexamples represent principled combinations of descriptive and revisionary elements rather than taxonomy failures. This analysis advances both our theoretical understanding of conceptual analysis and provides practical methodological guidance for selecting and evaluating analytical approaches.

## Main Thesis
Different types of conceptual analysis can be distinguished and evaluated through specific methodological commitments: descriptive analysis requires consistency with linguistic practices and intuitive support, while revisionary analysis demands theoretical precision and demonstrable explanatory gains, with selection between approaches governed by whether the objective is concept clarification or improvement.

## Core Contribution
The paper develops a systematic framework that both distinguishes between descriptive and revisionary conceptual analysis through explicit success criteria and provides practical methodology selection principles based on philosophical objectives, advancing both theoretical understanding and research practice.

## Key Moves
- Establish distinct success criteria through targeted analysis of paradigm cases in descriptive and revisionary analysis
- Develop selection principles based on whether philosophical objectives require concept clarification or improvement
- Demonstrate framework through focused examination of historical debates where methodological confusion led to persistent disagreement
- Address potential objections by showing how apparent counterexamples often represent principled hybrid approaches

## Development Notes
Refinements enhance clarity and practical applicability while maintaining theoretical sophistication. Success criteria now explicitly tied to distinct analytical objectives. Abstract better frames hybrid cases while maintaining word count. Case study approach tightened through focus on methodological confusion in debates. Changes preserve key theoretical insights while improving framework usability.
