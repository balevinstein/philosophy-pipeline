    "abstract": "Contemporary debates about conceptual analysis often focus on its general validity while overlooking important methodological differences between distinct types of analysis. This paper develops a novel framework distinguishing descriptive from revisionary conceptual analysis through systematic evaluation criteria: descriptive analysis requires consistency with established usage and robust intuitive support, while revisionary analysis demands theoretical precision and demonstrated explanatory gains. Building on work in application conditionals and addressing Quinean challenges to analyticity, I demonstrate how selecting between approaches depends on specific philosophical objectives - whether clarifying existing concepts or engineering improved ones. The framework reveals how many apparent counterexamples represent principled combinations of descriptive and revisionary elements rather than taxonomy failures. This analysis advances both our theoretical understanding of conceptual analysis and provides practical methodological guidance for selecting and evaluating analytical approaches.",
    "main_thesis": "Different types of conceptual analysis can be distinguished and evaluated through specific methodological commitments: descriptive analysis requires consistency with linguistic practices and intuitive support, while revisionary analysis demands theoretical precision and demonstrable explanatory gains, with selection between approaches governed by whether the objective is concept clarification or improvement.",
    "core_contribution": "The paper develops a systematic framework that both distinguishes between descriptive and revisionary conceptual analysis through explicit success criteria and provides practical methodology selection principles based on philosophical objectives, advancing both theoretical understanding and research practice.",

    "development_notes": "Refinements enhance clarity and practical applicability while maintaining theoretical sophistication. Success criteria now explicitly tied to distinct analytical objectives. Abstract better frames hybrid cases while maintaining word count. Case study approach tightened through focus on methodological confusion in debates. Changes preserve key theoretical insights while improving framework usability.",
