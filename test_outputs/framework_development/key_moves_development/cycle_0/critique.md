# Scratch Work

Initial observations:
- Moves build progressively from criteria to selection to validation
- Heavy reliance on knowledge/causation examples for development
- Strong connection to Chalmers/Jackson on implicit analysis
- Need to address Quinean concerns throughout
- Framework validation critical for practical utility

Dependencies:
1. Success criteria foundational for later moves
2. Selection principles rely on established criteria
3. Framework validation tests both criteria and principles
4. Integration needed between descriptive/revisionary approaches

Key challenges:
- Balancing theoretical sophistication with practical utility
- Managing scope within word constraints
- Maintaining clear distinctions while acknowledging complexity
- Supporting claims with limited literature base

# Move Analysis

## Move 1: Establish Success Criteria
Argument assessment:
- Knowledge/causation examples well-chosen but need careful development
- Clear connection between aims and criteria
- Could strengthen theoretical justification

Development feasibility:
+ Examples manageable within space constraints
+ Clear development path through criteria extraction
- May need tighter scoping of theoretical background

Literature support:
+ Can use Chalmers/Jackson on implicit analysis
+ Need to explicitly address Quinean concerns
- Could use more support for criteria distinction

Integration:
+ Sets up later moves effectively
+ Connects well to theoretical foundations
- May need stronger bridge to selection principles

Recommendations:
1. Tighten theoretical development
2. Add explicit Quinean response
3. Strengthen criteria/aims connection

## Move 2: Develop Selection Principles
Argument assessment:
+ Clear connection to objectives
+ Practical methodology focus
- Could strengthen theoretical grounding

Development feasibility:
+ Framework clear and developable
- May need more concrete examples
+ Space available for key points

Literature support:
- Limited direct support from provided sources
+ Can build on Chalmers/Jackson methodology
+ Address Quinean holism concerns

Integration:
+ Builds naturally from criteria
+ Enables framework validation
- May need stronger theoretical connection

Recommendations:
1. Add concrete selection examples
2. Strengthen theoretical foundation
3. Clarify methodology development

## Move 3: Historical Debate Analysis
Argument assessment:
+ Shows practical relevance
+ Demonstrates framework utility
- Need careful case selection

Development feasibility:
- May be too broad as currently framed
+ Could focus on specific illustrative debates
+ Space for focused analysis

Literature support:
- Limited historical cases in provided literature
+ Can use papers' methodological insights
- May need to narrow scope

Integration:
+ Tests framework effectively
+ Shows practical application
- Ensure maintains theoretical focus

Recommendations:
1. Focus on fewer, deeper case studies
2. Strengthen theoretical connections
3. Tighten scope for space constraints

## Move 4: Address Counterexamples
Argument assessment:
+ Anticipates key objections
+ Shows framework flexibility
- Could strengthen theoretical basis

Development feasibility:
+ Clear approach to hybrid cases
+ Manageable within space
- May need example tightening

Literature support:
+ Can use papers' methodological tools
- Limited direct support for hybrid approach
+ Framework consistent with sources

Integration:
+ Strengthens overall framework
+ Connects to earlier moves
- Ensure maintains focus

Recommendations:
1. Tighten example selection
2. Strengthen theoretical foundation
3. Clarify hybrid case handling

# Cross-Cutting Considerations

Dependencies:
- Success criteria fundamental to later moves
- Selection principles rely on clear criteria
- Validation tests both aspects
- Need consistent theoretical framework

Literature coverage:
+ Good use of Chalmers/Jackson methodology
+ Addresses Quinean concerns
- May need more targeted support for distinctions

Framework support:
+ Moves build progressively
+ Clear theoretical development
- May need stronger connections between moves

# Summary Assessment
MINOR REFINEMENT

The key moves are fundamentally sound but need targeted improvements:
1. Tighten theoretical development throughout
2. Strengthen connections between moves
3. Focus examples more precisely
4. Better integrate literature support

Next steps:
1. Revise theoretical foundations
2. Tighten example selection
3. Strengthen move connections
4. Clarify methodology development

The framework shows promise but needs refinement to maximize effectiveness within space constraints while maintaining theoretical sophistication.
