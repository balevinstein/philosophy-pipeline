# Scratch Work

Key considerations:
1. Need to show meaningful difference in success criteria between descriptive/revisionary approaches
2. Examples should be clear but substantive enough to demonstrate distinction
3. Must connect back to theoretical foundations while moving argument forward
4. Should enable methodology development in subsequent sections

Possible approaches:
1. Contrast pair analysis - examine same concept through both lenses
2. Historical case studies - show evolution of concepts
3. Contemporary debates - analyze live philosophical disagreements
4. Methodological reconstruction - examine successful analyses

Think the contrast pair approach might work best because:
- Directly demonstrates distinction
- Controls for content differences
- Allows focused criteria development
- Natural connection to methodology

# Final Argument Development

## Argument Sketch

1. Begin with paradigm case of "knowledge" analysis
   - Descriptive approach: capturing ordinary usage/intuitions
   - Revisionary approach: developing precise epistemic concept
   - Show how different aims lead to different success criteria

2. Develop general principles from case analysis
   - Descriptive: linguistic fit, intuitive alignment, explanatory adequacy
   - Revisionary: theoretical precision, explanatory power, practical utility

3. Connect criteria to methodological requirements
   - How criteria shape appropriate methods
   - Why different approaches need different tools

## Initial Examples

Primary Example: Knowledge
- Descriptive analysis examines ordinary language use, epistemic intuitions
- Revisionary analysis focuses on theoretical role, epistemic practices
- Shows how same target yields different analyses based on aims

Supporting Example: Causation
- Descriptive: capturing common causal reasoning
- Revisionary: developing scientifically useful concept
- Reinforces criteria distinction while showing broader application

## Key Steps

1. Establish clear cases of each type of analysis
2. Extract implicit success criteria
3. Show how criteria reflect fundamental aims
4. Demonstrate systematic differences
5. Connect to methodological implications

## Integration Notes

- Builds on theoretical foundations from Section 2
- Sets up methodology development in Section 3
- Provides framework for selection principles in Section 4
- Creates examples for validation in Section 5

This approach:
- Maintains focus on core distinction
- Advances main thesis about methodological clarity
- Fits paper structure
- Enables subsequent development
- Keeps argument manageable within word limits

Critical to maintain tight connection between examples and theoretical development while avoiding excessive detail in any single case.
