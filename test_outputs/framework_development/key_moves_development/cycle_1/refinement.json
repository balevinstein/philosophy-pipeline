Tighten Quinean discussion to focus on specific challenges to framework\n- Rationale: Maintains theoretical rigor while keeping scope manageable\n- Implementation: Focus on holism and analyticity as they directly affect criteria development\n\n2.

Develop knowledge example to bridge descriptive/revisionary approaches\n- Rationale: Provides concrete illustration of framework integration\n- Implementation: Show how same concept can require different approaches based on objectives\n\n4.

Expand hybrid approach criteria beyond current scope\n- Rationale: Would require too much space and risk theoretical complexity\n- Alternative: Show how existing criteria handle hybrid cases\n\n2.
