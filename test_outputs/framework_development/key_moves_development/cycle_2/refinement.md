# Scratch Work
Key considerations from critique:
- Theoretical integration needs strengthening, especially application conditionals
- Methodological progression could be clearer
- Hybrid case treatment needs development
- Literature usage could be optimized

Dependencies to manage:
- Success criteria must ground selection principles
- Framework validation depends on clear methodology
- Counterexample treatment needs systematic approach
- All changes must maintain Quinean challenge responses

# Refinement Decisions

## Will Implement
1. Strengthen application conditionals usage in Move 1 -- Provides stronger theoretical foundation and better literature integration
2. Develop explicit methodology for hybrid cases in Move 2 -- Addresses key weakness while maintaining scope
3. Tighten methodological focus in personal identity case study -- Makes better use of space while strengthening validation
4. Add systematic case selection criteria for counterexamples -- Improves rigor without expanding scope

## Won't Implement
1. Additional case studies -- Would exceed space constraints without proportional benefit
2. Expanded theoretical foundations section -- Current framework sufficient with better integration
3. More detailed success criteria -- Could overcomplicate without adding substantive value

# Updated Move Development

Move 1: Establish Success Criteria
- Begin with Quinean challenges to analyticity
- Introduce application conditionals as theoretical framework
- Develop knowledge example showing how application conditionals handle both descriptive/revisionary analysis
- Demonstrate how success criteria emerge from theoretical framework
- Connect criteria types through shared foundation in application conditionals

Move 2: Selection Principles
- Ground selection in application conditionals framework
- Focus on clarification vs improvement aims
- Develop explicit methodology for hybrid cases using application conditionals
- Show systematic treatment of holistic considerations
- Demonstrate methodology through structured examples

Move 3: Framework Validation
- Use personal identity debate focusing specifically on methodological confusion
- Show how application conditionals clarify descriptive/revisionary elements
- Demonstrate explicit success criteria application
- Connect validation to theoretical foundations

Move 4: Address Counterexamples
- Establish explicit case selection criteria based on theoretical framework
- Use application conditionals to analyze challenging cases
- Show systematic treatment through established methodology
- Maintain tight connection to success criteria

# Change Notes

Theoretical Foundations
- Strengthened through consistent application conditionals usage
- Better addresses Quinean challenges through systematic approach
- Maintains original insights while improving integration

Move Interactions
- Clearer progression from criteria to selection to validation
- Better theoretical continuity across moves
- Stronger connections between methodology and application

Literature Integration
- More systematic use of Chalmers/Jackson framework
- Better engagement with Quinean challenges
- Maintains appropriate scope of literature usage

Framework Alignment
- Enhanced consistency across moves
- Stronger theoretical foundation supports framework
- Better handling of hybrid cases maintains framework integrity

Development Feasibility
- All changes maintain word count constraints
- Focus improvements make better use of space
- Systematic approach aids concise development

Dependencies
- Success criteria now better ground selection principles
- Methodology flows more clearly into validation
- Counterexample treatment more systematically connected
- Theoretical foundations better support all moves

The refinements strengthen theoretical integration and methodological clarity while maintaining the core framework and feasibility within space constraints. The enhanced use of application conditionals provides better literature support and addresses Quinean challenges more systematically.
