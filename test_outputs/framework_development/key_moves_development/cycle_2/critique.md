# Scratch Work
Key considerations across moves:
- Success criteria development needs tight connection to application conditionals
- Framework validation requires careful balance of descriptive/revisionary elements
- Selection principles must clearly link to theoretical foundations
- Counterexample treatment needs systematic approach

Dependencies:
Move 1 → Move 2: Success criteria inform selection principles
Move 2 → Move 3: Selection principles guide framework validation
Move 3 → Move 4: Case studies inform counterexample treatment
All moves depend on theoretical foundations from Quine and Chalmers/Jackson

# Move Analysis

## Move 1: Establish Success Criteria
Argument assessment:
- Strong connection to application conditionals
- Clear progression from Quinean challenges
- Well-structured development through knowledge example
- Could strengthen connection between criteria types

Development feasibility:
+ Knowledge example provides concrete development path
+ Application conditionals offer clear theoretical framework
- May need tighter integration of descriptive/revisionary distinction
- Space constraints could limit example development

Literature support:
+ Chalmers/Jackson provide theoretical tools
+ Quine frames key challenges to address
- Could better leverage application conditionals framework

Integration recommendations:
1. Strengthen connection between criteria types using application conditionals
2. Develop knowledge example with explicit descriptive/revisionary elements
3. Tighten theoretical foundation integration

## Move 2: Selection Principles
Argument assessment:
+ Clear connection to theoretical foundations
+ Strong focus on core distinction
+ Good integration with criteria
- Could strengthen hybrid case treatment

Development feasibility:
+ Scope appropriate for space constraints
+ Clear development path through framework
- May need more detailed methodology
- Hybrid cases need careful handling

Literature support:
+ Can use application conditionals for methodology
- Could better leverage Quinean holism insights

Integration recommendations:
1. Strengthen hybrid case methodology
2. Develop clearer connection to success criteria
3. Add explicit treatment of holistic considerations

## Move 3: Framework Validation
Argument assessment:
+ Personal identity debate well-chosen
+ Clear demonstration potential
- Could strengthen theoretical connections
- May need additional case support

Development feasibility:
+ Single case study manageable in space
- May need tighter focus on methodological elements
+ Clear development path through debate

Literature support:
- Limited direct support in provided literature
+ Can use application conditionals framework

Integration recommendations:
1. Tighten focus on methodological confusion
2. Strengthen theoretical connections
3. Develop explicit success criteria application

## Move 4: Address Counterexamples
Argument assessment:
+ Systematic approach through application conditionals
+ Good theoretical foundation connection
- Could strengthen selection criteria
- May need more explicit methodology

Development feasibility:
+ Limited scope appropriate
+ Clear development path
- May need more specific case selection criteria

Literature support:
+ Can leverage Chalmers/Jackson framework
+ Quinean concerns provide context

Integration recommendations:
1. Develop explicit case selection criteria
2. Strengthen methodological framework
3. Tighten connection to success criteria

# Cross-Cutting Considerations
Dependencies well-handled overall but need:
- Stronger theoretical integration across moves
- More explicit success criteria application
- Better hybrid case treatment
- Clearer methodological progression

Literature coverage adequate but could:
- Make better use of application conditionals
- More explicitly address Quinean concerns
- Strengthen theoretical foundations

# Summary Assessment
MINOR REFINEMENT

The moves are fundamentally sound but need targeted improvements:
1. Strengthen theoretical integration
2. Develop clearer methodological progression
3. Improve hybrid case treatment
4. Make better use of literature resources

Next steps should focus on tightening connections between moves while maintaining current structure. Key priorities are strengthening theoretical foundations and developing clearer methodology.
