# Scratch Work
Initial observations:
- Moves show good logical progression from theoretical foundations through application
- Strong conceptual coherence around descriptive/revisionary distinction
- Literature engagement focused but could be strengthened
- Some potential gaps in handling methodological objections

Dependencies and interactions:
1. Success criteria move underpins selection principles
2. Historical debates provide validation context
3. Hybrid approaches address key objections
4. All moves support main thesis about distinct types

# Move Analysis

## Establish Success Criteria
- Argument Assessment: Strong conceptual development, clear connection to thesis
- Development Feasibility: Reasonable within space constraints (~1000 words)
- Literature Support: Could better leverage Chalmers/Jackson on application conditionals
- Integration: Sets up later moves effectively
- Recommendations:
  * Strengthen connection to literature on non-definitional analysis
  * Add explicit criteria for evaluating intuitive support
  * Clarify relationship between linguistic and theoretical precision

## Develop Selection Principles
- Argument Assessment: Clear objective-method mapping, good handling of hybrid cases
- Development Feasibility: Well-scoped for available space
- Literature Support: Could better address Quinean concerns about meaning
- Integration: Builds effectively on success criteria
- Recommendations:
  * Add explicit discussion of how selection handles semantic holism
  * Strengthen theoretical justification for objective distinctions
  * Include more detailed methodology for hybrid cases

## Historical Debates Examination 
- Argument Assessment: Good choice of causation example, clear framework application
- Development Feasibility: May need tighter focus to fit space
- Literature Support: Appropriate engagement level
- Integration: Validates earlier theoretical moves
- Recommendations:
  * Tighten focus on methodological rather than substantive disagreement
  * Add explicit success criteria application
  * Consider reducing supporting examples

## Address Hybrid Approaches
- Argument Assessment: Strong theoretical foundation, good examples
- Development Feasibility: Well-structured for space constraints
- Literature Support: Could better engage Quinean holism
- Integration: Effectively addresses key objections
- Recommendations:
  * Strengthen theoretical grounding of hybrid criteria
  * Add explicit connection to success criteria
  * Clarify relationship to selection principles

# Cross-Cutting Considerations

Dependencies:
- Success criteria development must precede selection principles
- Historical examples need established framework
- Hybrid approaches rely on clear distinctions

Literature Coverage:
- Could better integrate Chalmers/Jackson on application conditionals
- Need stronger engagement with Quinean challenges
- Consider adding contemporary conceptual engineering literature

Framework Support:
- Moves collectively support main thesis
- Good balance between theoretical and practical elements
- Clear progression from foundations to application

# Summary Assessment
MINOR REFINEMENT

The moves are fundamentally sound and work together effectively to support the paper's thesis. Key improvements needed:
1. Strengthen literature engagement, especially with Quinean challenges
2. Tighten connections between success criteria and selection principles
3. Better theoretical grounding for hybrid approaches
4. More explicit methodology for evaluating intuitive support

Next steps:
1. Revise success criteria move to better incorporate literature
2. Tighten historical debates section
3. Strengthen theoretical foundations for hybrid approaches
4. Add explicit methodology for evaluating support types

The framework is viable and well-structured but needs targeted refinements to strengthen its theoretical foundations and practical applicability.
