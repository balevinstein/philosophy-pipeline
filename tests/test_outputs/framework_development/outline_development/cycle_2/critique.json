Key recommendations focus on redistributing Section 3 content, strengthening literature integration, and tightening the validation approach. These changes will improve feasibility while maintaining the strong conceptual foundation and logical progression.\n\nThe core structure is sound, but refinements will enhance development space for key elements while ensuring appropriate literature engagement and maintaining feasibility within the word limit. The suggested adjustments preserve the essential framework while creating better conditions for detailed development.",
