      "Literature Integration": "Opportunities:\n- Use Quine to frame methodological challenges\n- Leverage Chalmers/Jackson for analysis without definitions\n- Draw on application conditionals for success criteria\n\nGaps:\n- Limited direct support for descriptive/revisionary distinction\n- May need more theoretical grounding for selection principles",
