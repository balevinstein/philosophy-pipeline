# Scratch Work
- Historical illustration section does appear oversized given word limit
- Success criteria development needs stronger theoretical grounding
- Literature engagement could be more systematic
- Framework validation needs dedicated space
- Single case study approach would allow deeper analysis within constraints

# Framework Support Analysis
Main Thesis Support:
- Needs stronger theoretical foundation for success criteria
- Could better highlight descriptive/revisionary distinction
- Selection principles require more explicit development

Core Contribution:
- Framework development needs more dedicated space
- Practical methodology deserves earlier introduction
- Validation should precede counterexamples

Key Moves:
- Success criteria establishment needs more space
- Selection principles could be more prominent
- Case study approach should be more focused

Literature Engagement:
- Quine needs earlier introduction
- Application conditionals could better support framework
- Need explicit space for contemporary debates

# Refinement Decisions
## Will Implement
1. Restructure Section 2 to strengthen theoretical foundation
2. Compress historical illustration to single focused case study
3. Add dedicated framework validation subsection
4. Move selection principles earlier in development
5. Create explicit literature engagement section

## Won't Implement
1. Complete restructuring of Section 2 as suggested - current progression better supports thesis development
2. Adding multiple case studies - would dilute focus
3. Separate theoretical/practical sections - integration better serves argument

# Updated Outline

## 1. Introduction
- Frame the problem: methodological confusion in debates about conceptual analysis
- Preview novel framework distinguishing descriptive/revisionary approaches
- State thesis and roadmap
- Note significance for both theory and practice

## 2. Contemporary Debates and Challenges
### 2.1 Methodological Challenges
- Quinean challenges to analyticity
- Contemporary responses and limitations
- Need for systematic framework

### 2.2 Existing Approaches
- Current theoretical landscape
- Application conditionals and analysis without definitions
- Gaps in methodological guidance

## 3. Framework Development
### 3.1 Types of Analysis
- Descriptive vs revisionary distinction
- Theoretical foundations
- Methodological commitments

### 3.2 Success Criteria
- Descriptive criteria: linguistic consistency and intuitive support
- Revisionary criteria: theoretical precision and explanatory gains
- Theoretical justification and practical application

### 3.3 Selection Principles
- Linking objectives to methods
- Decision framework
- Handling hybrid approaches

## 4. Framework Validation
### 4.1 Theoretical Assessment
- Internal coherence
- Literature alignment
- Methodological advances

### 4.2 Case Study
- Selected debate analysis
- Framework application

- Future directions
- Reaffirm contribution

# Change Notes
- Restructured to provide stronger theoretical foundation
- Added dedicated contemporary debates section
- Framework development now more systematic
- Validation separate from application
- Single focused case study
- Better supports key moves through clearer progression
- More efficient use of word limit
- Stronger literature engagement throughout
- Maintains coherent development path
- Better supports both theoretical and practical aspects of contribution
