# Scratch Work
Key considerations:
- Framework development requires clear progression from foundational concepts through application
- Available literature primarily addresses methodological challenges rather than providing direct support
- 4,000 words requires careful scope management and efficient argument development
- Core framework needs space for both theoretical justification and practical demonstration
- Historical cases must be carefully selected to maximize insight with minimal space

# Framework Alignment Analysis
Strengths:
- Clear connection between abstract's key claims and section development
- Logical progression from foundations through application
- Space allocated for both theoretical and practical elements
- Framework components receive dedicated coverage

Weaknesses:
- Success criteria section may need more explicit connection to literature
- Selection principles could benefit from stronger theoretical grounding
- Historical illustration section risks taking too much space for core argument value

# Structural Analysis
Strengths:
- Logical progression from theory to application
- Clear dependencies between sections
- Balanced treatment of framework elements
- Space for counterexample engagement

Concerns:
- Historical illustration section potentially oversized
- Framework application subsection needs tighter focus
- Could strengthen theoretical foundation before case studies

# Feasibility Assessment
Rough word allocation needed:
- Introduction: 500
- Foundations/Framework: 1,500
- Historical Illustration: 1,000
- Counterexamples: 500
- Conclusion: 500

Tight but feasible if:
- Historical cases are carefully selected
- Framework presentation is efficient
- Counterexamples are strategically chosen

# Literature Integration
Opportunities:
- Use Quine to frame methodological challenges
- Leverage Chalmers/Jackson for analysis without definitions
- Draw on application conditionals for success criteria

Gaps:
- Limited direct support for descriptive/revisionary distinction
- May need more theoretical grounding for selection principles

# Red Flags
- Historical illustration section risks consuming too much space
- Framework application subsection needs tighter scope
- Success criteria development may need stronger literature connection
- Selection principles require careful theoretical grounding

# Specific Recommendations
1. Compress historical illustration section:
   - Focus on single carefully chosen case
   - Tighter integration with framework development

2. Strengthen theoretical foundation:
   - Expand success criteria development
   - Better ground selection principles

3. Restructure Section 2:
   ```
   2. Foundations and Framework
   2.1 Conceptual Analysis and Methodological Challenges
   2.2 Framework Development
   2.3 Success Criteria and Selection Principles
   ```

4. Tighten case study focus:
   - Select single case demonstrating methodological confusion
   - Use for targeted framework validation

5. Add explicit framework validation subsection before counterexamples

# Summary Assessment
MINOR REFINEMENT

The outline provides a fundamentally sound structure but needs targeted adjustments to:
- Better balance theoretical development and practical demonstration
- Strengthen connections to available literature
- Ensure feasibility within word constraints
- Tighten focus of historical illustration

The core framework development path is clear and logical, but some restructuring will improve efficiency and strengthen key elements while maintaining feasibility.
