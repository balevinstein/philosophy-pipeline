  "abstract": "Contemporary debates about conceptual analysis often focus on its general validity while overlooking important methodological differences between distinct types of analysis. This paper develops a novel framework distinguishing descriptive from revisionary conceptual analysis based on their primary aims and success criteria. Descriptive analysis seeks to capture existing usage and intuitions, while revisionary analysis prioritizes theoretical utility and precision. Through detailed examination of case studies and historical debates, I demonstrate how this distinction illuminates persistent disagreements about proper analytical methodology. The framework provides clear criteria for selecting between descriptive and revisionary approaches based on specific philosophical objectives, while showing how apparent counterexamples often represent sophisticated hybrid cases rather than taxonomy failures. This analysis offers practical guidance for methodology selection while advancing our theoretical understanding of conceptual analysis as a philosophical tool.",
  "main_thesis": "Different types of conceptual analysis can be distinguished based on their methodological commitments: descriptive analysis prioritizes capturing existing usage and intuitions, while revisionary analysis prioritizes theoretical utility and precision, with each type having distinct success criteria and appropriate applications.",

  "development_notes": "The framework is designed to be both theoretically substantive and practically useful, addressing a clear gap in the literature around methodology selection for conceptual analysis. The distinction between descriptive and revisionary approaches emerged naturally from the literature review while offering novel insight. The key moves are concrete and developable within the word limit, with each building on the previous to construct a complete argument. The framework engages seriously with Quinean challenges while offering a positive account of how different forms of conceptual analysis can succeed under different conditions.",
