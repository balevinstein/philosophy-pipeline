    "Establish distinct success criteria through targeted analysis of paradigm cases in descriptive and revisionary analysis": {
      "content": "Let me think through this carefully and develop the argument systematically.\n\n# Scratch Work\nKey considerations:\n- Need to show genuine difference in success criteria while maintaining connection\n- Examples should be familiar enough to be intuitive but complex enough to reveal important distinctions\n- Must connect back to theoretical foundations established earlier\n- Should set up later applications without getting too far ahead\n\nPossible approaches:\n1. Contrastive case analysis showing same concept treated differently\n2. Failed analysis examples revealing distinct failure modes\n3. Historical progression showing evolution of methods\n4. Contemporary debate illustration showing parallel tracks\n\nThe contrastive case approach seems most promising as it:\n- Demonstrates distinction concretely\n- Maintains tight focus on criteria\n- Builds naturally from foundations\n- Sets up methodology clearly\n\n# Final Argument Development\n\n## Argument Sketch\n1. Introduction of paradigm case: concept of knowledge\n- Traditional analysis seeking necessary/sufficient conditions\n- Experimental philosophy revealing varied intuitions\n- Theoretical reconstruction for epistemic purposes\n\n2. Analysis of descriptive success criteria through failed attempts\n- Show how linguistic inconsistency undermines\n- Demonstrate role of conflicting intuitions\n- Establish baseline requirements\n\n3. Analysis of revisionary success criteria through theoretical aims\n- Show how theoretical precision drives different standards\n- Demonstrate role of explanatory power\n- Establish distinct requirements\n\n4. Synthesis showing complementary nature while maintaining distinction\n- Different objectives require different standards\n- Standards interact but remain separate\n- Framework for principled selection\n\n## Initial Examples\nPrimary: Knowledge\n- JTB analysis as descriptive attempt\n- Gettier problems revealing intuitive complexities\n- Knowledge-first approaches as revisionary\n\nSupporting: Causation\n- Common sense usage vs scientific conception\n- Competing intuitions about prevention/allowance\n- Theoretical reconstruction for specific domains\n\n## Key Steps\n1. Establish clear cases of each type of analysis\n2. Extract implicit success criteria\n3. Show how criteria differ systematically\n4. Demonstrate practical significance of distinction\n5. Connect to broader theoretical framework\n\n## Integration Notes\n- Builds directly on theoretical foundations\n- Sets up methodology section\n- Provides concrete basis for selection principles\n- Supports overall thesis about distinct but complementary approaches\n\nThe argument would develop through careful examination of how different analyses of knowledge succeed or fail according to distinct criteria, using this to extract and justify separate standards while maintaining their interconnection. This supports the paper's broader framework while remaining focused on the core distinction."

    "Develop selection principles based on whether philosophical objectives require concept clarification or improvement": {
      "content": "# Scratch Work\n\nKey considerations:\n1. Need to connect philosophical objectives to methodological choices\n2. Distinction between clarification vs improvement must be principled\n3. Selection principles should be action-guiding\n4. Framework must handle hybrid/mixed cases\n5. Examples should illustrate clear contrasts\n\nPotential approaches:\n- Start with paradigm cases of each type\n- Develop diagnostic criteria\n- Map objectives to methodological requirements\n- Address boundary cases\n\nChallenges to work through:\n- Avoiding false dichotomy\n- Maintaining practical utility\n- Justifying classification choices\n- Handling evolving objectives\n\n# Final Argument Development\n\n## Argument Sketch\n\n1. Begin by establishing two distinct philosophical objectives:\n   - Concept clarification: Understanding existing conceptual usage/content\n   - Concept improvement: Enhancing conceptual utility/precision\n\n2. Develop selection criteria based on project goals:\n   - If primary aim is understanding current usage \u2192 descriptive methods\n   - If primary aim is increasing precision/utility \u2192 revisionary methods \n\n3. Justify connection between objectives and methods:\n   - Clarification requires fidelity to actual usage\n   - Improvement requires theoretical optimization\n   - Methods must align with success conditions\n\n4. Address hybrid cases through weighted considerations:\n   - Identify primary vs secondary objectives\n   - Apply proportional methodological mix\n   - Maintain clear success criteria\n\n## Initial Examples\n\n1. Free Will Debate\n   - Clarification: Understanding folk concepts of responsibility\n   - Improvement: Developing more precise metaphysical framework\n   \n2. Personal Identity\n   - Clarification: Mapping psychological continuity intuitions\n   - Improvement: Engineering better theoretical criteria\n\n## Key Steps\n\n1. Establish objective identification criteria\n   - Examine stated aims\n   - Analyze success conditions\n   - Consider theoretical context\n\n2. Link objectives to methodological requirements\n   - Map clarification needs to descriptive methods\n   - Map improvement needs to revisionary approaches\n   - Justify connections\n\n3. Develop selection principles\n   - If primary aim is understanding \u2192 prioritize descriptive\n   - If primary aim is enhancement \u2192 prioritize revisionary\n   - For mixed cases \u2192 weight proportionally\n\n4. Validate through case studies\n   - Apply to paradigm cases\n   - Test boundary conditions\n   - Demonstrate practical utility\n\n## Integration Notes\n\nThis argument:\n- Builds on theoretical foundations from Section 2\n- Operationalizes criteria from Section 3\n- Sets up applications in Section 4\n- Prepares for validation in Section 5\n\nConnects to main thesis by:\n- Providing principled selection framework\n- Maintaining descriptive/revisionary distinction\n- Offering practical methodological guidance\n- Supporting hybrid approaches where warranted\n\nKey emphasis points:\n- Objective-driven selection\n- Principled methodology\n- Practical applicability\n- Theoretical coherence\n\nThis development maintains focus on the core distinction while providing actionable guidance for method selection based on philosophical objectives."

    "Demonstrate framework through focused examination of historical debates where methodological confusion led to persistent disagreement": {
      "content": "# Scratch Work\n\nKey considerations:\n- Need examples that clearly show methodological confusion rather than just substantive disagreement\n- Examples should span both descriptive and revisionary approaches\n- Should demonstrate how framework could have helped resolve or clarify the debate\n- Must be substantial enough to be compelling but contained enough to fit space constraints\n\nPotential historical debates to examine:\n1. Free will/moral responsibility debates - Often unclear whether participants are doing descriptive analysis of folk concepts or proposing revised technical concepts\n2. Personal identity debates - Methodological shifts between psychological and physical continuity approaches without explicit acknowledgment\n3. Causation debates - Mixed aims between analyzing ordinary usage and developing scientific concepts\n\nStructure options:\n1. Deep dive into single example\n2. Brief treatment of multiple examples\n3. Primary example with supporting cases\n\n# Final Argument Development\n\n## Argument Sketch\n\n1. Frame the methodological confusion problem using causation debates as primary example\n2. Identify specific instances where participants talk past each other due to unclear methodological commitments\n3. Apply framework to show how explicit attention to descriptive vs revisionary aims would clarify positions\n4. Demonstrate how framework guides methodology selection\n5. Connect to broader theoretical implications\n\n## Initial Examples\n\nPrimary Example: Causation Debates\n- Lewis's counterfactual analysis as supposedly descriptive\n- Salmon's process theory as explicitly revisionary\n- Contemporary hybrid approaches without clear methodological foundations\n\nSupporting Cases:\n- Brief reference to personal identity debates\n- Note parallel structure in free will discussions\n\n## Key Steps\n\n1. Establish historical context of causation debate\n2. Identify specific exchanges showing methodological confusion\n3. Apply framework components:\n   - Evaluate descriptive vs revisionary aims\n   - Assess success criteria alignment\n   - Demonstrate methodology selection\n4. Show how framework clarifies positions\n5. Extract general lessons\n\n## Integration Notes\n\n- Connects directly to theoretical foundations section\n- Provides concrete illustration of framework components\n- Supports thesis about methodological clarity\n- Sets up validation section\n- Maintains focus on descriptive/revisionary distinction\n- Can be executed within word limit constraints\n- Builds on existing literature while advancing novel framework\n\nThis approach allows for sufficient depth while maintaining broader relevance and supporting the paper's main thesis. The causation debate provides rich material for illustrating methodological confusion while remaining manageable within space constraints."

Start with seeming counterexamples and reveal hybrid structure\n2. Develop theoretical basis first, then apply to cases\n3. Compare successful vs unsuccessful hybrid approaches\n\nExample types to consider:\n- Conceptual engineering cases\n- Scientific concept development\n- Social/political concept evolution\n\n# Final Argument Development\n\n## Argument Sketch\n\n1. Frame apparent tension between descriptive and revisionary approaches\n2. Show how successful conceptual development often combines both:\n   - Descriptive elements preserve useful connections\n   - Revisionary elements enable theoretical progress\n3. Demonstrate how framework explains this pattern\n4.
