    "argument_development": "# Scratch Work\n\nKey considerations to work through:\n\n1. The distinction needs to be both theoretically sound and practically applicable\n2. Criteria should be clear enough to enable classification but flexible enough to handle edge cases\n3. Need to avoid making the distinction too rigid/artificial while maintaining its usefulness\n4. Examples should demonstrate real methodological differences rather than surface features\n\nPossible approaches:\n1. Start with paradigm cases and extract defining features\n2. Begin with theoretical aims and derive methodological commitments\n3. Focus on success criteria and work backwards\n4. Examine historical examples and synthesize patterns\n\nTesting approach #2 seems most promising as it:\n- Grounds the distinction in fundamental philosophical goals\n- Allows methodological differences to emerge naturally\n- Can accommodate hybrid cases\n- Links directly to selection criteria needed later\n\n# Final Argument Development\n\n## Argument Sketch\n\n1. Primary Aims\n- Descriptive Analysis aims to accurately capture existing conceptual usage and intuitions\n- Revisionary Analysis aims to develop more precise/useful theoretical tools\n- These distinct aims drive different methodological choices\n\n2. Methodological Commitments\n- Descriptive: \n  * Prioritizes alignment with common usage\n  * Emphasizes gathering empirical linguistic/psychological data\n  * Seeks to minimize theoretical modification\n- Revisionary:\n  * Prioritizes theoretical utility\n  * Emphasizes logical precision and systematic integration\n  * Willing to deviate from common usage when beneficial\n\n3. Success Criteria\n- Descriptive:\n  * Accuracy in capturing existing usage/intuitions\n  * Explanatory power for actual conceptual practices\n  * Minimal deviation from common understanding\n- Revisionary:\n  * Increased theoretical precision/utility\n  * Better integration with broader theoretical framework\n  * Improved problem-solving capability\n\n## Initial Examples\n\n1. Descriptive Analysis:\n- Traditional analysis of \"knowledge\" attempting to capture ordinary usage\n- Investigations of moral concepts based on widespread intuitions\n\n2. Revisionary Analysis:\n- Scientific refinement of concepts like \"species\" or \"mass\"\n- Philosophical reconstruction of problematic concepts like \"truth\"\n\n## Key Steps\n\n1. Establish fundamental difference in aims\n2. Show how methodological commitments follow from aims\n3. Derive success criteria from methods/aims\n4. Demonstrate through examples\n5. Address potential objections/edge cases\n\n## Integration Notes\n\nThis argument:\n- Supports main thesis by providing clear theoretical foundation\n- Sets up framework for selection criteria\n- Enables analysis of hybrid cases\n- Connects to historical debates section\n- Provides basis for case study analysis\n\nThe focus on aims rather than surface features helps maintain theoretical depth while ensuring practical applicability.",
    "challenge_analysis": "# Scratch Work\n\nLet me think through some key potential failure modes for this argumentative move:\n\n1. Distinction Collapse\n- Risk that the criteria aren't truly distinct enough\n- Many real cases might be hybrid, weakening the framework's utility\n- Need to ensure the distinction captures meaningful methodological differences\n\n2. Oversimplification\n- Complex philosophical practices might resist clean categorization\n- Could miss important nuances in how analysis is actually conducted\n- Risk of creating artificial binary rather than useful spectrum\n\n3. Historical Accuracy\n- Need to verify that distinction maps onto actual historical debates\n- Risk of retroactively imposing contemporary categories\n- Must account for evolving understanding of conceptual analysis\n\n4. Practical Applicability\n- Framework needs to actually help philosophers choose methods\n- Risk of criteria being too abstract to guide concrete decisions\n- Challenge of handling edge cases\n\n# Final Analysis\n\n## Potential Challenges\n\n1. Distinction Collapse\n- Severity: High\n- Description: If the criteria don't maintain clear separation between types, the entire framework loses utility\n- Mitigation: \n  * Focus on fundamental aims rather than surface features\n  * Explicitly address hybrid cases as legitimate approaches\n  * Demonstrate distinct methodological consequences\n\n2. Historical Integration\n- Severity: Medium\n- Description: Framework must illuminate rather than distort historical debates\n- Mitigation:\n  * Use historical cases to refine rather than just validate framework\n  * Acknowledge evolution of analytical approaches\n  * Show how framework reveals previously obscured patterns\n\n3. Practical Implementation\n- Severity: Medium\n- Description: Framework must provide actionable guidance\n- Mitigation:\n  * Include concrete decision criteria\n  * Provide detailed case studies\n  * Address common edge cases explicitly\n\n## Critical Dependencies\n\n1. Theoretical Foundations\n- Distinct aims must genuinely lead to different methodological commitments\n- Success criteria must follow naturally from aims/methods\n- Framework must capture real methodological differences\n\n2. Historical Support\n- Historical debates should reflect proposed distinction\n- Framework should illuminate rather than contradict historical development\n- Should help explain persistent disagreements\n\n3. Practical Utility\n- Framework must help guide actual methodological choices\n- Criteria need to be clear enough for application\n- Must handle edge cases without losing distinctiveness\n\n## Feasibility Assessment\n\nOverall Assessment: Feasible with careful development\nConfidence Level: Medium-High\n\nKey Considerations:\n1. Strong theoretical foundation in different analytical aims\n2. Clear connection to methodological practices\n3. Supported by historical examples\n4. Practical utility demonstrated through case studies\n\n## Risk Mitigation\n\n1. Strengthen Theoretical Foundation\n- Develop detailed argument connecting aims to methods\n- Show how success criteria emerge naturally\n- Address potential objections pre-emptively\n\n2. Enhance Historical Integration\n- Use historical cases during framework development\n- Show how framework illuminates persistent debates\n- Acknowledge evolution of approaches\n\n3. Ensure Practical Utility\n- Include detailed selection criteria\n- Provide concrete examples of application\n- Address common edge cases explicitly\n\n4. Balance Precision and Flexibility\n- Maintain clear distinction while allowing for hybridity\n- Focus on fundamental rather than surface features\n- Develop nuanced criteria for classification\n\nThe move appears feasible but requires careful development to avoid potential pitfalls. Success depends on maintaining theoretical rigor while ensuring practical utility."
