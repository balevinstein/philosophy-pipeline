  "development_notes": "Development Notes\n\nCritical Connections:\n- Framework (Section 2) must clearly establish distinctions that illuminate historical analysis (Section 3)\n- Case studies (Section 4) should directly demonstrate framework elements from Section 2\n- Selection criteria (5.1) should follow naturally from previous sections\n\nDevelopment Challenges:\n- Maintaining focus on methodological rather than substantive issues in case studies\n- Balancing theoretical development with practical guidance\n- Ensuring counterexamples section strengthens rather than undermines framework\n- Managing word count while maintaining sufficient detail in case studies\n\nPriority Areas:\n- Clear articulation of success criteria for each type\n- Strong examples in case studies section\n- Practical usefulness of selection criteria\n- Robust handling of hybrid cases",
