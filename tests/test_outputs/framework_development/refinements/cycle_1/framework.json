    "abstract": "Contemporary debates about conceptual analysis often focus on its general validity while overlooking important methodological differences between distinct types of analysis. Building on existing work in application conditionals and addressing Quinean challenges to analyticity, this paper develops a novel framework distinguishing descriptive from revisionary conceptual analysis through systematic evaluation criteria. Descriptive analysis evaluates concepts against established linguistic practices and shared intuitions, while revisionary analysis prioritizes theoretical utility and explanatory power. Through examination of paradigm cases and methodological debates, I demonstrate how this distinction illuminates persistent disagreements about proper analytical methodology. The framework provides clear principles for selecting between descriptive and revisionary approaches based on specific philosophical objectives, while showing how apparent counterexamples often represent sophisticated hybrid cases rather than taxonomy failures. This analysis advances both our theoretical understanding of conceptual analysis and provides practical methodological guidance.",
    "main_thesis": "Different types of conceptual analysis can be distinguished through specific methodological commitments and success criteria: descriptive analysis evaluates concepts against established linguistic practices and shared intuitions, while revisionary analysis prioritizes theoretical precision and explanatory utility, with each type requiring distinct evaluative frameworks.",
    "core_contribution": "The paper develops a systematic framework that both distinguishes between descriptive and revisionary conceptual analysis through explicit success criteria and provides practical methodology selection principles, advancing both theoretical understanding and research practice.",

Abstract better previews methodology while maintaining word count. Case study approach clarified through key moves without overcomplicating framework. Changes preserve theoretical sophistication while enhancing practical applicability.",
