# Scratch Work
Key considerations from critique analysis:
- Stronger literature engagement would strengthen theoretical foundations
- Explicit success criteria development is valuable but must fit word limit
- Hybrid cases discussion valuable but should remain secondary to core distinction
- Application conditionals provide useful methodological tool without requiring full commitment

Assessing component interactions:
- Adding application conditionals affects methodology discussion across components
- Success criteria development links to both types of analysis
- Literature positioning must remain balanced given constraints
- Core distinction must stay clear despite added complexity

# Refinement Decisions
Will implement:
- Add explicit mention of Quinean challenges in abstract
- Incorporate application conditionals as methodological tool
- Strengthen success criteria development in key moves
- Add clearer methodology for distinguishing types

Won't implement:
- Extensive hybrid cases discussion (would detract from core focus)
- Full decision tree (too complex for word limit)
- Heavy literature positioning (beyond our citation capabilities)

# Framework Components

## Abstract
Contemporary debates about conceptual analysis often focus on its general validity while overlooking important methodological differences between distinct types of analysis. Building on existing work in application conditionals and addressing Quinean challenges to analyticity, this paper develops a novel framework distinguishing descriptive from revisionary conceptual analysis based on their primary aims and success criteria. Descriptive analysis seeks to capture existing usage and intuitions, while revisionary analysis prioritizes theoretical utility and precision. Through examination of case studies and methodological debates, I demonstrate how this distinction illuminates persistent disagreements about proper analytical methodology. The framework provides clear criteria for selecting between descriptive and revisionary approaches based on specific philosophical objectives, while showing how apparent counterexamples often represent sophisticated hybrid cases rather than taxonomy failures. This analysis advances both our theoretical understanding of conceptual analysis and provides practical methodological guidance.

## Main Thesis
Different types of conceptual analysis can be distinguished based on their methodological commitments and success criteria: descriptive analysis prioritizes capturing existing usage and intuitions, while revisionary analysis prioritizes theoretical utility and precision, with each type requiring distinct evaluative approaches.

## Core Contribution
The paper provides a systematic framework for distinguishing between descriptive and revisionary conceptual analysis through clear success criteria and methodological principles, while offering practical guidance for methodology selection in philosophical research.

## Key Moves
- Develop methodological principles for distinguishing analysis types using application conditionals and success criteria
- Establish specific success criteria for both descriptive and revisionary analysis
- Analyze historical debates to show how the distinction illuminates methodological disagreements
- Present focused case studies demonstrating practical application of success criteria
- Address potential objections by showing how the framework accommodates sophisticated hybrid approaches

## Development Notes
Refinements strengthen theoretical foundations through explicit engagement with application conditionals and Quinean challenges while maintaining practical focus. Success criteria are now more central to the framework, providing clear evaluative tools. The core descriptive/revisionary distinction remains primary while acknowledging hybrid complexity. Changes maintain feasibility within word limit while adding methodological sophistication.
