# Scratch Work
- Strong foundational structure establishing clear distinction between types
- Effectively sets up practical value alongside theoretical contribution
- Could more explicitly engage with Quinean challenges mentioned in synthesis
- Success criteria and methodology selection need more prominence in abstract
- May need stronger positioning within existing conceptual analysis debates
- Case study approach well-indicated but could be more specific
- Balance between description and prescription could be clearer

# Critical Analysis
Strengths:
- Clear main thesis distinguishing descriptive/revisionary analysis
- Practical focus on methodology selection
- Well-structured progression from distinction to application
- Appropriate scope for 4,000-word format
- Good balance of theoretical and practical contributions

Weaknesses:
- Insufficient engagement with fundamental challenges to conceptual analysis
- Could better anticipate potential objections
- Success criteria need more prominence given their centrality
- Historical context could be better established
- Hybrid cases mention feels underdeveloped

# Specific Areas for Improvement
1. Add early acknowledgment of challenges to conceptual analysis while positioning framework as practical response:
"While fundamental challenges to conceptual analysis persist, philosophical practice requires practical methodological guidance. This paper develops..."

2. Strengthen success criteria discussion in abstract:
"The framework establishes distinct success criteria for each approach: descriptive analysis succeeds through alignment with linguistic intuitions and usage patterns, while revisionary analysis succeeds through theoretical fertility and precision."

3. Better contextualize the contribution:
"Building on recent defenses of conceptual analysis that don't require explicit definitions, this framework offers..."

4. Clarify hybrid cases:
"The framework accommodates sophisticated hybrid approaches where descriptive and revisionary elements combine to serve complex philosophical objectives."

# Additional Opportunities
1. Consider explicitly mentioning application to contemporary philosophical debates

2. Could strengthen methodology section by indicating specific analytical tools being developed

3. Potential to highlight how framework bridges traditional analytic/synthetic concerns

4. Might include brief mention of how framework handles implicit vs explicit analysis

# Summary Assessment
MINOR REFINEMENT

The abstract provides a strong foundation but would benefit from more explicit engagement with fundamental challenges and clearer articulation of success criteria. The basic structure and approach are sound, requiring only targeted improvements to better position the work within existing debates and clarify its practical applications.

The suggested refinements maintain the current direction while strengthening the abstract's ability to anticipate and address potential concerns. The framework's practical value comes through clearly, but its theoretical sophistication could be better highlighted through more explicit engagement with foundational issues in conceptual analysis.
