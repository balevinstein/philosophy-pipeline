# Scratch Work
Key considerations from critique:
- Need stronger theoretical foundations throughout
- Example selection needs more focus
- Move connections could be stronger
- Literature support needs better integration

Dependencies analysis:
- Success criteria form foundation for later moves
- Theoretical clarity essential for framework coherence
- Examples must serve clear argumentative purpose
- Quinean concerns need consistent treatment

Literature constraints:
- Limited to Quine plus Chalmers/Jackson
- Must build framework within these bounds
- Need careful use of available theoretical tools

# Refinement Decisions

## Will Implement

1. Strengthen theoretical foundations
- Add explicit section linking Chalmers/Jackson application conditionals to success criteria
- Shows how framework operates without strong analyticity
- Supported by available literature

2. Focus example selection
- Limit to knowledge example for primary development
- Use causation only as brief supporting case
- Maintains depth while controlling scope

3. Tighten move connections
- Add explicit bridges between criteria and selection principles
- Show how theoretical foundations inform each move
- Strengthens overall coherence

4. Clarify hybrid case handling
- Develop systematic approach using application conditionals
- Show how framework accommodates complexity
- Builds on theoretical foundations

## Won't Implement

1. Add more historical case studies
- Limited literature support available
- Space constraints prohibitive
- Core argument achievable without

2. Expand theoretical background
- Would exceed scope/space constraints
- Core sources sufficient for framework
- Focus on depth over breadth better

# Updated Move Development

Move 1: Establish Success Criteria
- Begin with application conditionals framework
- Show how different aims affect success conditions
- Develop knowledge example in detail
- Address Quinean concerns explicitly

Move 2: Selection Principles
- Connect directly to theoretical foundations
- Show how criteria inform selection
- Provide concrete methodology guidance
- Maintain theoretical sophistication

Move 3: Framework Validation
- Focus on single detailed case study
- Show framework resolving methodological confusion
- Demonstrate practical utility
- Maintain theoretical connections

Move 4: Address Counterexamples
- Use application conditionals for hybrid cases
- Show systematic treatment possibility
- Connect to theoretical foundations
- Maintain scope control

# Change Notes

Theoretical Foundations:
- Stronger integration of Chalmers/Jackson
- More systematic treatment of Quinean concerns
- Clearer theoretical progression

Move Interactions:
- Explicit bridges between moves
- Consistent theoretical framework
- Clear development path

Literature Integration:
- More focused use of sources
- Better theoretical support
- Maintained within constraints

Framework Alignment:
- Stronger theoretical coherence
- Better practical applicability
- Clear methodological guidance

Development Feasibility:
- Controlled scope through example focus
- Space for theoretical development
- Manageable case analysis

Dependencies:
- Clear theoretical progression
- Strong foundational support
- Systematic development path

These refinements strengthen the theoretical foundations while maintaining practical utility and development feasibility within constraints.
