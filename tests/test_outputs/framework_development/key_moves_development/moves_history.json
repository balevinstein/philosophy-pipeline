    "# Scratch Work\n\nKey considerations:\n1. Need to show meaningful difference in success criteria between descriptive/revisionary approaches\n2. Examples should be clear but substantive enough to demonstrate distinction\n3. Must connect back to theoretical foundations while moving argument forward\n4. Should enable methodology development in subsequent sections\n\nPossible approaches:\n1. Contrast pair analysis - examine same concept through both lenses\n2. Historical case studies - show evolution of concepts\n3. Contemporary debates - analyze live philosophical disagreements\n4. Methodological reconstruction - examine successful analyses\n\nThink the contrast pair approach might work best because:\n- Directly demonstrates distinction\n- Controls for content differences\n- Allows focused criteria development\n- Natural connection to methodology\n\n# Final Argument Development\n\n## Argument Sketch\n\n1. Begin with paradigm case of \"knowledge\" analysis\n   - Descriptive approach: capturing ordinary usage/intuitions\n   - Revisionary approach: developing precise epistemic concept\n   - Show how different aims lead to different success criteria\n\n2. Develop general principles from case analysis\n   - Descriptive: linguistic fit, intuitive alignment, explanatory adequacy\n   - Revisionary: theoretical precision, explanatory power, practical utility\n\n3. Connect criteria to methodological requirements\n   - How criteria shape appropriate methods\n   - Why different approaches need different tools\n\n## Initial Examples\n\nPrimary Example: Knowledge\n- Descriptive analysis examines ordinary language use, epistemic intuitions\n- Revisionary analysis focuses on theoretical role, epistemic practices\n- Shows how same target yields different analyses based on aims\n\nSupporting Example: Causation\n- Descriptive: capturing common causal reasoning\n- Revisionary: developing scientifically useful concept\n- Reinforces criteria distinction while showing broader application\n\n## Key Steps\n\n1. Establish clear cases of each type of analysis\n2. Extract implicit success criteria\n3. Show how criteria reflect fundamental aims\n4. Demonstrate systematic differences\n5. Connect to methodological implications\n\n## Integration Notes\n\n- Builds on theoretical foundations from Section 2\n- Sets up methodology development in Section 3\n- Provides framework for selection principles in Section 4\n- Creates examples for validation in Section 5\n\nThis approach:\n- Maintains focus on core distinction\n- Advances main thesis about methodological clarity\n- Fits paper structure\n- Enables subsequent development\n- Keeps argument manageable within word limits\n\nCritical to maintain tight connection between examples and theoretical development while avoiding excessive detail in any single case.",
    "Move 1: Establish Success Criteria\n- Begin with application conditionals framework\n- Show how different aims affect success conditions\n- Develop knowledge example in detail\n- Address Quinean concerns explicitly\n\nMove 2: Selection Principles\n- Connect directly to theoretical foundations\n- Show how criteria inform selection\n- Provide concrete methodology guidance\n- Maintain theoretical sophistication\n\nMove 3: Framework Validation\n- Focus on single detailed case study\n- Show framework resolving methodological confusion\n- Demonstrate practical utility\n- Maintain theoretical connections\n\nMove 4: Address Counterexamples\n- Use application conditionals for hybrid cases\n- Show systematic treatment possibility\n- Connect to theoretical foundations\n- Maintain scope control",
