# Scratch Work
The moves form a logical progression:
1. Success criteria establishment (foundational)
2. Selection principles (builds on criteria)
3. Framework validation (tests/demonstrates)
4. Counterexample handling (strengthens/defends)

Key dependencies:
- Selection principles require clear success criteria
- Validation needs both criteria and principles established
- Counterexample treatment depends on full framework

Literature alignment:
- Chalmers/Jackson useful for success criteria without requiring complete definitions
- Quine's challenges must be addressed in criteria development
- Need to show framework's viability given semantic holism

# Move Analysis

## Move 1: Establish Success Criteria
Argument assessment:
- Strong conceptual foundation using application conditionals
- Clear differentiation between descriptive/revisionary criteria
- Quinean concerns explicitly addressed
- Knowledge example provides concrete illustration

Development feasibility:
+ Application conditionals framework provides clear structure
+ Knowledge example well-chosen and manageable
- May need tighter scope on Quinean discussion
- Could strengthen connection between criteria types

Literature support:
+ Can leverage Chalmers/Jackson on implicit analysis
+ Direct engagement with Quine's challenges
- May need additional support for revisionary criteria

Integration with framework:
+ Forms essential foundation for later moves
+ Connects clearly to selection principles
+ Supports validation approach

Recommendations:
1. Tighten Quinean discussion to essential points
2. Strengthen theoretical justification for revisionary criteria
3. Develop knowledge example with more explicit connections

## Move 2: Selection Principles
Argument assessment:
+ Clear connection to theoretical foundations
+ Practical methodology well-grounded
- Could strengthen justification for hybrid approaches

Development feasibility:
+ Clear development path from criteria
+ Concrete methodology guidelines feasible
- May need to limit number of principles covered

Literature support:
+ Can use application conditionals framework
- Limited direct literature support for selection approach

Integration with framework:
+ Builds naturally from success criteria
+ Enables validation and counterexample treatment
+ Supports practical application

Recommendations:
1. Focus on core selection principles
2. Strengthen theoretical justification
3. Develop clearer hybrid approach criteria

## Move 3: Framework Validation
Argument assessment:
+ Focused case study approach promising
+ Clear demonstration of practical utility
- Could strengthen theoretical connections

Development feasibility:
+ Single detailed case study manageable
- May need tighter scope on implications

Literature support:
+ Can draw on papers for methodology
- Limited direct validation examples

Integration with framework:
+ Tests both criteria and principles
+ Supports counterexample treatment
+ Demonstrates practical value

Recommendations:
1. Select case study carefully for maximum impact
2. Maintain tight focus on key framework elements
3. Strengthen theoretical connections

## Move 4: Address Counterexamples
Argument assessment:
+ Systematic approach using application conditionals
+ Clear connection to framework
- Could strengthen theoretical foundation

Development feasibility:
+ Clear scope with hybrid cases focus
+ Manageable within space constraints
- May need to limit number of examples

Literature support:
+ Can use Chalmers/Jackson framework
+ Connects to Quinean concerns

Integration with framework:
+ Strengthens overall argument
+ Shows framework flexibility
+ Supports practical application

Recommendations:
1. Focus on most challenging counterexamples
2. Strengthen theoretical treatment
3. Maintain tight connection to framework

# Cross-Cutting Considerations
Dependencies well-handled overall but need attention to:
- Consistent theoretical framework across moves
- Clear progression from criteria to application
- Balanced treatment of descriptive/revisionary approaches

Literature coverage adequate but could strengthen:
- Support for revisionary criteria
- Validation examples
- Selection principles justification

# Summary Assessment
MINOR REFINEMENT

The moves are fundamentally sound and well-structured but need targeted improvements:
1. Strengthen theoretical foundations for revisionary analysis
2. Tighten scope of Quinean discussion
3. Develop clearer criteria for hybrid approaches
4. Select case study strategically
5. Focus counterexample treatment

Next steps should focus on these refinements while maintaining the strong overall structure.
