# Scratch Work
- Main critique points to need for stronger theoretical foundations while maintaining practical utility
- Quinean discussion needs focused treatment that supports framework without getting lost in details
- Knowledge example could better connect descriptive/revisionary approaches
- Hybrid case treatment needs clearer theoretical grounding
- Case study selection crucial for demonstrating framework value

Key dependencies to consider:
- Success criteria must address Quinean concerns while remaining practically applicable
- Selection principles need clear grounding in theoretical foundations
- Case study must demonstrate both descriptive and revisionary elements
- Counterexample treatment must flow naturally from established framework

# Refinement Decisions

## Will Implement

1. Tighten Quinean discussion to focus on specific challenges to framework
- Rationale: Maintains theoretical rigor while keeping scope manageable
- Implementation: Focus on holism and analyticity as they directly affect criteria development

2. Strengthen revisionary criteria theoretical foundation
- Rationale: Currently underdeveloped compared to descriptive criteria
- Implementation: Use application conditionals to develop explicit success conditions

3. Develop knowledge example to bridge descriptive/revisionary approaches
- Rationale: Provides concrete illustration of framework integration
- Implementation: Show how same concept can require different approaches based on objectives

4. Select personal identity debate for case study
- Rationale: Demonstrates both descriptive and revisionary elements clearly
- Implementation: Focus on methodological confusion between describing common usage and engineering improved concepts

## Won't Implement

1. Expand hybrid approach criteria beyond current scope
- Rationale: Would require too much space and risk theoretical complexity
- Alternative: Show how existing criteria handle hybrid cases

2. Add additional validation examples
- Rationale: Single well-developed case more effective within space constraints
- Alternative: Strengthen theoretical connections in main case study

# Updated Move Development

Move 1: Establish Success Criteria
- Begin with Quinean challenges to analyticity and holism
- Show how application conditionals address these while maintaining practical utility
- Develop knowledge example showing descriptive/revisionary distinction
- Connect criteria types through shared theoretical foundation

Move 2: Selection Principles
- Ground selection in theoretical foundations
- Focus on core distinction between clarification and improvement aims
- Show how criteria inform methodology choice
- Demonstrate application to hybrid cases through established framework

Move 3: Framework Validation
- Use personal identity debate as primary case study
- Show how framework clarifies methodological confusion
- Demonstrate both descriptive and revisionary elements
- Connect to theoretical foundations throughout

Move 4: Address Counterexamples
- Focus on cases challenging descriptive/revisionary distinction
- Use application conditionals to show systematic treatment
- Maintain tight connection to theoretical foundations
- Limit to most challenging cases

# Change Notes

Theoretical Foundations:
- Stronger integration of Quinean concerns
- Clearer connection between descriptive and revisionary approaches
- More robust treatment of success criteria

Move Interactions:
- Knowledge example now better connects Move 1 to Move 2
- Case study selection strengthens validation-counterexample connection
- Theoretical foundations more consistently maintained

Literature Integration:
- More focused use of Quine
- Better leverage of Chalmers/Jackson framework
- Clearer connection to application conditionals

Framework Alignment:
- Maintains core distinction while showing connections
- Better handles hybrid cases through established criteria
- Stronger theoretical-practical balance

Development Feasibility:
- Tighter scope on theoretical discussions
- More focused case study approach
- Manageable treatment of counterexamples

Dependencies:
- Success criteria now better support selection principles
- Case study more effectively demonstrates framework
- Counterexample treatment flows more naturally from established foundations

These refinements maintain the paper's core contribution while strengthening theoretical foundations and practical applicability.
