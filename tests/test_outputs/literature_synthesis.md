## Literature Synthesis

The papers represent two crucial perspectives on conceptual analysis that inform our project. Quine's "Two Dogmas" presents fundamental challenges to traditional conceptual analysis that any contemporary account must address. Chalmers and Jackson demonstrate a sophisticated approach that combines descriptive and revisionary elements, showing how conceptual analysis can proceed without requiring explicit definitions.

## Key Arguments and Moves

* Quine's critique of analyticity forces us to be precise about the theoretical commitments of our framework
* Chalmers and Jackson show how application conditions can ground rigorous analysis without explicit definitions
* Both papers highlight the importance of theoretical goals in shaping methodology
* The tension between these approaches helps motivate our pluralistic framework

## Development Strategy

1. Begin by acknowledging Quine's critique while showing how our framework avoids key problems
2. Use Chalmers and Jackson as case study for sophisticated hybrid analysis
3. Develop clear success criteria for different types of analysis
4. Show how our framework accommodates holistic considerations while maintaining useful distinctions

## Critical Points

* Must address how we can maintain useful distinctions without requiring strong analytic/synthetic divide
* Need to show how different types of analysis can be rigorous without circular definitions
* Important to demonstrate how theoretical goals legitimately shape methodology
* Critical to explain how holistic considerations affect success criteria

## Risks and Challenges

* Risk of appearing to ignore Quine's fundamental critiques
* Challenge of maintaining clear distinctions while acknowledging holism
* Need to avoid oversimplifying complex relationship between description and revision
* Risk of framework being too abstract without concrete examples

## Additional Notes and Observations

* Unexpected connection between holism and revisionary analysis worth developing
* Both papers show importance of theoretical commitments in shaping methodology
* Potential to use Chalmers/Jackson's work as bridge between traditional and contemporary approaches
* Consider developing extended example that demonstrates both types of analysis

## Next Stage Preparation

1. Develop clear statement of how framework addresses Quinean concerns
2. Prepare concrete examples of different types of analysis
3. Articulate success criteria for each type
4. Draft outline that:
   - Acknowledges historical critiques
   - Presents positive framework
   - Demonstrates practical applications
   - Addresses theoretical challenges
