# Curated Philosophical Moves for Pipeline Injection

## abstract_development
Moves for developing clear thesis statements and framing

### Example 1: Special Cases Restriction Maneuver
**Pattern**: When universal claim faces counterexamples: (1) acknowledge the exceptions, (2) restrict scope appropriately, (3) argue restricted conclusion still philosophically important
**Quote**: However, even if we accept the existence of either essentialist facts or totality facts and their being 'ungroundable' in this weak sense of possibility, we can simply restrict (PG) to conjunctions of...
**Source**: There are no fundamental facts by Roberto Loss

### Example 2: Mechanism-Testing Through Systematic Variation
**Pattern**: When mechanism M is proposed, test M across varied contexts to identify its scope and limits
**Quote**: An important property of conversational implicatures arising from an utterance of a certain form of words is that they do not arise in every context in which that form of words is uttered. In particul...

### Example 3: Scope Limitation via Idealization Defense
**Pattern**: Acknowledge apparent counterexample → Restrict scope to domain where counterexample doesn't apply → Justify restriction as theoretically appropriate
**Quote**: The Guaranteed Principle does not hold of imperfect agents, nor of agents who expect to be imperfect. Take an extreme illustration. Suppose that the least choiceworthy option made available by a decis...

## key_moves_development
Core dialectical and conceptual moves

### Example 1: Inductive Plausibility Defense
**Pattern**: For controversial principle P: (1) show P holds for uncontroversial cases, (2) argue no clear counterexamples, (3) claim prima facie warrant
**Quote**: Jago claims that (P) can be defeasibly justified as follows. First, he argues that, quite plausibly, at least some of the truthmaker maximalist approaches on the market are logically consistent. Then ...

### Example 3: Autonomous Facts Alternative Principle
**Pattern**: When principle P faces objection O: (1) construct weaker principle P+ that avoids O, (2) show P+ still sufficient for main conclusion, (3) argue P+ equally plausible as P
**Quote**: However, in order to ward off this objection it appears sufficient to replace (PG) with the following, similarly plausible principle: (PG+) (◊GA ∧ (A ∧ B)) → ◊(GA ∧ B). (PG+) says that if it is the ca...

## outline_development
Structural and organizational moves

### Example 1: Bridge Case Construction for Principle Application
**Pattern**: Embed problematic case X within larger choice structure Y to make principle Z directly applicable
**Quote**: To get the argument going, consider the following elaboration of The Frustrater: (Two Rooms) An agent must enter either Room #1 or Room #2. If she enters Room #1, she gets $35. If she enters Room #2, ...
**Source**: An argument against causal decision theory by Jack Spencer

### Example 2: Operational Definition by Grounding Profile
**Pattern**: Define abstract operations by their systematic effects: (1) State general principle as slogan, (2) Give precise clauses for each operation, (3) Show how clauses justify desired principles
**Quote**: On the present structured account ground and antiground enter the picture in the definitions of the logical operations themselves – the idea being that a logical operation is defined by the contributi...

## critics_all
Moves showing philosophical rigor for critics to look for

### Example 1: Infinite Lottery Counterexample
**Pattern**: Use extreme mathematical cases to reveal conceptual problems in standard theories
**Quote**: It is well understood that if rational credences are real-valued, then there are some possible events that are assigned 0 credence nonetheless, for example a particular ticket winning in a fair infini...

### Example 2: Empirical Prediction via Theoretical Application
**Pattern**: Apply theoretical distinction to extreme case → Derive specific prediction about intuitive responses → Use prediction to test theory against alternatives → Present as evidence for theoretical superiority
**Quote**: However, the coercer has no grounds besides the joint intention on which they can make demands. To explain this, the notion of respect is critical again. By forcing me to engage in an immoral joint ac...
