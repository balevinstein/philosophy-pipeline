If d1 is a decision that forces $n, and d2 is just like d1 except that it makes additional options available, then a rational agent weakly prefers d2 to d1.

The agent has three options: she can take A, B or the envelope (aA, aB or aE). The envelope contains $40. The two boxes together contain $100.

'Slow down, James! I don't want to walk so fast', she demands. John keeps walking and eventually, he is so far ahead of her that the ordinary concept of walking together no longer applies to them. Paula is confused. Did James not owe it to her to slow down? Did he not respect her enough to at least say goodbye? I argue that we can identify two distinct kinds of failure in Paula and James's joint action that have so far not been sufficiently distinguished in the debate on joint intention. One mistake is James's failure to contribute to the implicitly established joint intention to, say, have an interesting conversation, that is, to 'do his part' (to use Tuomela's (1989) expression).

It would be appropriate for Paula to resent James \u2013 not for failing to contribute to their earlier joint intention or for changing his mind \u2013 but simply for not respecting her enough to at least notify her when he wishes to end the joint action. In the case of the first failure, it would be inappropriate if Paula were to resent James even before he apologizes and changes the subject. It is not permissible to resent your collaborator for making a mistake relative to the joint intention unless it is done disrespectfully, for example repeatedly and intentionally.

The function of his second apology is different compared with the function of his first apology. The first signaled that he recognized his mistake (relative to their joint intention) and that he had no justification or excuse for it. The apology is not an attempt to fix the moral relationship with Paula. The relationship was not broken. He is not asking for forgiveness and there is no need for it. Whatever he did, it showed no sign of disrespect. It was an innocent mistake. Leaving the joint action without notification and without having discussed it with Paula signals the opposite (unless there is an excuse). It signals that he disregards Paula's legitimate claims. It suggests that he will immediately withdraw from the joint action if it no longer serves his interests. If James apologized later, this would not just have the function of signaling that he understood that his action did not contribute to the joint intention. By leaving, he had already signaled that he changed his mind and no longer had this intention. Instead, an apology would serve the function of repairing his moral relationship with Paula (cf. Walker 2006, Wallace 2019). This also entails a promise to act more respectfully in the future.",

We do not always know how best to fulfil a joint intention and we do not always know in what way the other person would like to fulfil it.

Such mistakes are bound to happen in any joint action. I do not need an excuse in such a case; I can admit that I made a mistake, say 'sorry' to signal that it was not due to a lack of cooperative intention, and we move on.

If it is true, then there is, indeed, such a person as God, a person who has created us in his image, who loves us, who desires that we know and love him. But if these things are so, then he would of course intend that we be able to be aware of his presence and to know something about him. And if that is so, the natural thing to think is that he created us in such a way that we would come to hold such true beliefs about God. The basic idea here is that if God exists, then he has created us in his image, desires for us to know him, and this means that God would probably have created us with an ability to know him. We may simplify Plantinga's thesis to this: (P) If God exists, then theistic belief is probably formed by properly functioning, reliable faculties.",

Moves are sometimes useful for their ability to push through stalemates by posing broader related questions. This move \u2013 'Meta-Question Shift' \u2013 invites us to probe a topic in the literature that enjoys a traditional articulation of its central problem. When we make this move, we examine not the content of the topic but the way we have hitherto been posing the central question about the target of our analysis. For example, we might be interested in quite distinct things when we pose the question 'what is consciousness?' Or when someone asks 'what is life?', one may have a very different question in mind from someone else investigating the same question. Shifting to the meta-question allows us to consider and potentially disentangle the distinct motivations and intentions behind the questions, as well as the different understandings of the problem. Do we want to know what causes consciousness? Do we want to know what sorts of things are conscious? Are we wondering how consciousness is consistent with a naturalistic worldview?",

Our folk theories misrepresent actual neural processes and, as a result, our chunking of psychological phenomena is misguided. A recent example can be found within the philosophy of biology, where Carlos Santana argues that the concept of biodiversity is just not useful. 'Biodiversity' is an eliminable stand-in for what we really care about: 'biological value'. It would be better to identify what we value and work to prioritize its conservation directly, whether that be the aesthetic sublimity of wilderness, the health benefits of clean air or the scientific value of rare and interesting types of living systems. The potential advantage of making this move is that it may inspire a radical and exciting re-conceptualization of a topic.

Accordingly, some philosophers of biology invite us to think of organisms as processes. Nicholson argues that 'the thermodynamic character of life demands a processual conception of the organism'. Organisms are not (simply) stuff; they are 'highly stabilized flows of energy and matter'. On this view, enduring organisms that persist through time and move in space should be considered abstractions from these stable processes. The explanation of why we apprehend an organism as a static object is near oxymoronic: because it is always changing. Organisms are characterized by continual material change with continual structural stability. More generally, a processual ontology will emphasize that the world is always changing. While thinking of patterns of processes as fixed objects will be useful in many cases, other times it will be more appropriate to retain a picture of inherent change.",
