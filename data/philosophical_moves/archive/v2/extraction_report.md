## Top 10 Patterns
1. Take target concept X, assume both P and ~P could have property X, derive contradiction, use modal logic to eliminate ungrounded cases (×1)
2. For controversial principle P: (1) show P holds for uncontroversial cases, (2) argue no clear counterexamples, (3) claim prima facie warrant (×1)
3. When universal claim faces counterexamples: (1) acknowledge the exceptions, (2) restrict scope appropriately, (3) argue restricted conclusion still philosophically important (×1)
4. When principle P faces objection O: (1) construct weaker principle P+ that avoids O, (2) show P+ still sufficient for main conclusion, (3) argue P+ equally plausible as P (×1)
5. When opponent offers counterexample C to principle P: show that C presupposes the falsity of your conclusion, making the objection question-begging (×1)
6. When accused of proving too much: (1) apply argument form to other domain, (2) show it fails there due to clear counterexamples, (3) argue target domain lacks such clear counterexamples (×1)
7. When argument leads to surprising consequence C: (1) acknowledge C is controversial, (2) show C follows from plausible premises, (3) frame as providing 'minimal support' rather than proof (×1)
8. When theory T is criticized as implausible, show that T's mechanisms parallel widely accepted cases in the same domain (×1)
9. When mechanism M is proposed, test M across varied contexts to identify its scope and limits (×1)
10. If opponent accepts principle P and case C, show that P applied to C yields consequences that undermine opponent's position (×1)
