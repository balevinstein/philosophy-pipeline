Suppose that the least choiceworthy option made available by a decision that guarantees $n is very bad indeed, and suppose that I have a lesion that makes me choose from among the least choiceworthy options when I face decisions of that sort. Then, as a way of protecting myself from my disposition to choose irrationally, I should prefer the decision that forces $m to the decision that guarantees $n > $m. But the Guaranteed Principle does not purport to hold true of imperfect agents. It is restricted to (perfectly) rational agents: the idealized agents that are the subject matter of decision theory. If an agent fully expects to choose from among the most choiceworthy options, as rational agents always do, then the agent must strictly prefer a decision that guarantees $n to a decision that forces $m < $n.",
