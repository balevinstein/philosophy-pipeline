Introduction\n- **Purpose**: Introduce challenges in maintaining political neutrality across diverse institutional contexts and present main thesis.\n\n- **Key Arguments**:\n  - Present mounting challenges in achieving political neutrality\n  - Highlight limitations of binary frameworks\n  - Introduce spectrum-based analytical approach\n  - State main thesis regarding domain-specific framework necessity\n\n## 2. Limitations of Binary Neutrality in Institutional Contexts\n- **Purpose**: Analyze specific limitations of binary neutrality conceptions.\n\n- **Key Arguments**:\n  - Examine binary framework failures across domains\n  - Analyze consequences in complex institutional settings\n  - Establish need for nuanced approach\n\n## 3. Framework Development and Assessment Methodology\n- **Purpose**: Present integrated framework development connecting theoretical foundations to practical metrics.\n\n- **Key Components**:\n  - Theoretical Foundations\n    - Spectrum-based neutrality conception\n    - Relationship to democratic principles\n    - Integration with existing neutrality theory\n\n  - Methodology Development\n    - Assessment criteria specification\n    - Measurement framework\n    - Threshold determination process\n\n  - Implementation Framework\n    - Stakeholder impact analysis\n    - Institutional constraint assessment\n    - Legitimacy requirement evaluation\n\n## 4. Democratic Principles and Theoretical Grounding\n- **Purpose**: Establish theoretical foundations and principle preservation.\n\n- **Key Arguments**:\n  - Equal treatment preservation\n  - Participatory access maintenance\n  - Reconciliation with neutrality ideals\n  - Theoretical justification for varying thresholds\n\n## 5.
