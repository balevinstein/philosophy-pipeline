    "abstract": "Contemporary governance faces mounting challenges in maintaining political neutrality across diverse institutional contexts, exposing limitations in traditional binary neutrality frameworks. We propose a spectrum-based analytical approach that establishes varying degrees of required neutrality across different political domains. Through systematic analysis combining institutional assessment with targeted neutrality metrics, we develop domain-specific thresholds based on stakeholder impact, implementation constraints, and democratic legitimacy requirements. This methodology enables practical neutrality implementation while preserving core democratic principles of equal treatment and participatory access. Drawing from theories of neutrality of treatment, we establish clear criteria for evaluating degrees of neutrality and demonstrate the framework's utility through examination of content moderation policy. Our approach advances political theory by reconciling neutrality ideals with institutional realities, offering both theoretical rigor and practical guidance for implementation.",
