# Scratch Work
Key considerations from critique:
- Need for systematic categorization of binary limitations
- Gaps in threshold determination process
- Risk of scope creep in framework development
- Literature support concentrated in Patten's work

Dependencies to consider:
- Binary limitations critique grounds spectrum approach
- Institutional analysis informs metrics
- Framework complexity affects case study utility

Theoretical implications:
- Must maintain connection to treatment-based neutrality
- Need clear extension beyond binary framework
- Downstream value conception supports domain variation

# Refinement Decisions

## Will Implement
1. Add explicit categorization scheme for binary limitations
- Categorize as: resource constraints, constitutional requirements, operational necessities
- Supports systematic framework development
- Well-supported by Patten's treatment framework

2. Strengthen threshold determination process
- Add specific criteria linking institutional analysis to threshold levels
- Include stakeholder impact measures
- Maintains feasible complexity

3. Tighten institutional context selection
- Focus on courts, platforms, and utilities as primary examples
- Provides sufficient variation while maintaining manageable scope
- Supports clear framework demonstration

## Won't Implement
1. Expanded metric complexity
- Risk of exceeding word limit
- Could overshadow theoretical foundations
- Not essential for framework demonstration

2. Additional literature integration
- Current foundation in Patten sufficient
- Additional sources might dilute core argument
- Limited available literature

# Updated Move Development

Move 1: "Identify specific limitations of binary neutrality conceptions"
- Systematic analysis of three limitation categories:
  - Resource constraints (time, space, attention)
  - Constitutional requirements (rights hierarchies)
  - Operational necessities (functional processes)
- Demonstrate through court, platform, utility examples
- Link to spectrum-based alternative through institutional analysis

Move 2: "Develop spectrum-based framework methodology"
- Clear threshold determination process:
  1. Institutional context analysis
  2. Constraint categorization
  3. Stakeholder impact assessment
  4. Threshold setting criteria
- Specific metrics for each constraint category
- Implementation guidance maintaining feasible complexity
