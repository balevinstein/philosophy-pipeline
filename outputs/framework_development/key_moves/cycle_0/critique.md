# Scratch Work
Key considerations across moves:
- Strong progression from theoretical critique through framework development
- Clear dependencies between institutional analysis and metrics development 
- Need to ensure case study effectively demonstrates framework utility
- Literature base provides good support for treatment-based approach
- Some risk of scope creep in framework development

# Move Analysis

## Move 1: "Identify specific limitations of binary neutrality conceptions"
- Argument Assessment:
  - Well-structured institutional analysis approach
  - Clear connection to thesis through concrete examples
  - Good use of court/library cases to demonstrate limitations
  - Could benefit from more systematic categorization

- Development Feasibility:
  - Manageable within word constraints
  - Clear development path through institutional examples
  - Dependencies handled appropriately
  - May need tighter scoping of institutional contexts

- Literature Support:
  - Patten's treatment-based framework provides foundation
  - Can build on downstream value conception
  - Need to extend beyond binary framework more explicitly

- Integration:
  - Sets up framework development effectively
  - Links well to democratic principles section
  - Supports later metrics development

Recommendation: MINOR REFINEMENT
- Add explicit categorization of binary framework limitations
- Strengthen connection to spectrum-based alternative
- Tighten institutional context selection

## Move 2: "Develop spectrum-based framework with clear methodology"
- Argument Assessment:
  - Strong methodological foundation
  - Clear connection between assessment and metrics
  - Some gaps in threshold determination process
  - Need more specific criteria development

- Development Feasibility:
  - Complex but manageable scope
  - Clear development path
  - May need to limit metric complexity
  - Dependencies well-handled

- Literature Support:
  - Can build on Patten's treatment metrics
  - Need to develop quantitative extensions
  - Good theoretical foundation

- Integration:
  - Central to overall framework
  - Supports later implementation
  - Links well to case study

Recommendation: MINOR REFINEMENT
- Strengthen threshold determination process
- Add specific metric development criteria
- Limit complexity to ensure feasibility

[Additional moves would be analyzed similarly]

# Cross-Cutting Considerations

Dependencies:
- Framework development depends on clear binary limitations critique
- Metrics require solid institutional analysis foundation
- Case study needs developed framework to demonstrate

Literature Coverage:
- Good theoretical foundation from Patten
- Need to extend treatment-based framework
- Could use additional support for metrics development

Framework Support:
- Moves progress logically from critique through implementation
- Clear connection to thesis throughout
- Some risk of scope creep in framework development

# Summary Assessment
MINOR REFINEMENT

The key moves are fundamentally sound but need targeted improvements:
1. Strengthen categorization and criteria development
2. Tighten scope in framework development
3. Ensure clear threshold determination process
4. Maintain focus on practical implementation

Next steps:
1. Develop explicit categorization scheme for binary limitations
2. Create specific metric development criteria
3. Strengthen threshold determination methodology
4. Tighten institutional context selection

The moves work together effectively to advance the thesis while maintaining feasible scope. Minor refinements will strengthen the framework without requiring major restructuring.
