# Scratch Work
- Critique identifies valid gaps in operationalization while preserving strong theoretical foundation
- Key challenge is maintaining balance between theoretical rigor and practical implementation
- Patten's framework needs more explicit integration, especially in metric development
- Example efficiency crucial for space management
- Need to ensure metric development process remains manageable within constraints

# Refinement Decisions

## Will Implement
1. Strengthen Patten framework integration -- Essential for theoretical grounding and provides clear basis for spectrum approach
2. Add structured metric development process -- Critical for implementation but can be done efficiently
3. Tighten example usage -- Improves space efficiency without losing illustrative value
4. Clarify threshold criteria methodology -- Important for framework utility while building on Patten's treatment concept

## Won't Implement
1. Detailed constraint categorization method -- Would add complexity without proportional benefit
2. Extensive operational details -- Risk exceeding space constraints and overcomplicating framework

# Updated Move Development

Move 1: "Identify specific limitations of binary neutrality conceptions"
- Begin with Patten's treatment framework analysis
- Demonstrate limitations through three categories:
  - Resource constraints (focused example: platform moderation)
  - Constitutional requirements (focused example: rights hierarchies)
  - Operational necessities (focused example: institutional process)
- Link limitations to spectrum necessity using Patten's downstream value conception
- Transition to framework development through institutional analysis lens

Move 2: "Develop spectrum-based framework methodology"
- Ground in Patten's treatment framework
- Metric development process:
  1. Context analysis (stakeholder identification, constraint mapping)
  2. Treatment requirement assessment (based on Patten's criteria)
  3. Threshold determination (using benefit criterion framework)
- Implementation guidance:
  - Clear threshold criteria tied to treatment requirements
  - Institutional capacity assessment
  - Stakeholder impact evaluation
- Validation process using treatment neutrality principles

# Change Notes
- Theoretical Foundations: Strengthened through explicit Patten framework integration
- Move Interactions: Enhanced connection between limitation analysis and framework development
- Literature Integration: Better leverages Patten's treatment framework and downstream value conception
- Framework Alignment: Maintains spectrum approach while improving theoretical grounding
- Development Feasibility: Streamlined example usage creates space for theoretical development
- Dependencies: Clear progression from limitations to framework development, supported by Patten's concepts

The refinements strengthen theoretical grounding while improving practical utility, maintaining manageable complexity within word constraints. The moves now more effectively support the thesis through clearer methodology and stronger theoretical foundation.
