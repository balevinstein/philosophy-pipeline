# Scratch Work
Initial observations:
- Moves 1 & 2 form the core theoretical and methodological foundation
- Strong connection to Patten's neutrality of treatment framework
- Need careful balance between theoretical rigor and practical implementation
- Clear progression from limitations analysis to framework development
- Some potential gaps in operationalization details

# Move Analysis

## Move 1: "Identify specific limitations of binary neutrality conceptions"
- Argument Assessment:
  - Strong categorization of limitation types
  - Clear connection to spectrum-based alternative
  - Could strengthen connection between examples and categories
  - Need more explicit link to Patten's treatment framework

- Development Feasibility:
  - Manageable within word constraints
  - Clear structure for development
  - Examples provide concrete anchors
  - May need to trim some detail to stay within limits

- Literature Support:
  - Builds well on Patten's critique of binary neutrality
  - Can leverage downstream value conception
  - Could strengthen connection to benefit criterion discussion
  - Need explicit engagement with implementation challenges

- Integration:
  - Sets up well for Move 2's framework development
  - Provides foundation for later threshold determination
  - Clear connection to main thesis
  - Supports overall spectrum-based approach

- Recommendations:
  1. Strengthen explicit connection to Patten's framework
  2. Tighten example development to ensure space efficiency
  3. Add clear transition to spectrum-based alternative
  4. Ensure limitation categories align with later metrics

## Move 2: "Develop spectrum-based framework methodology"
- Argument Assessment:
  - Clear process structure
  - Good balance of theory and practice
  - Needs more detail on metric development
  - Could strengthen threshold criteria justification

- Development Feasibility:
  - Complex but manageable within constraints
  - Clear development path
  - May need to limit metric detail
  - Process steps well-defined

- Literature Support:
  - Can build on Patten's treatment framework
  - Opportunity to extend theoretical base
  - Need careful engagement with practical limitations
  - Could leverage benefit criterion discussion

- Integration:
  - Builds directly from Move 1
  - Supports later implementation moves
  - Clear connection to thesis
  - Good foundation for case study

- Recommendations:
  1. Add specific metric development process
  2. Strengthen threshold criteria justification
  3. Clarify constraint categorization method
  4. Ensure feasible complexity level

# Cross-Cutting Considerations
- Dependencies:
  - Move 2 requires Move 1's limitation analysis
  - Both moves support later implementation
  - Framework development builds on theoretical foundation
  
- Overall Structure:
  - Clear progression from theory to practice
  - Good balance of conceptual and methodological elements
  - Some gaps in operational details
  - Strong connection to thesis

- Literature Coverage:
  - Good use of Patten's framework
  - Could strengthen engagement with practical challenges
  - Need careful extension of theoretical base
  - Clear connection to neutrality of treatment

# Summary Assessment
MINOR REFINEMENT

The moves are fundamentally sound with clear development paths and strong theoretical grounding. Key refinements needed:

1. Strengthen explicit connections to Patten's framework
2. Develop more detailed metric creation process
3. Tighten example usage for space efficiency
4. Clarify threshold determination criteria

The moves work well together and support the thesis effectively. Focus refinements on operational details while maintaining theoretical rigor.

Key priorities:
- Add metric development specifics
- Strengthen threshold criteria
- Ensure example efficiency
- Maintain manageable complexity
