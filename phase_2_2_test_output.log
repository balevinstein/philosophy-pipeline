  "abstract": "When someone acts wrongly from ignorance, we often blame them for their ignorance itself. But what kind of blame is this? Recent work has identified epistemic blame as a distinct kind of blame targeting violations of epistemic norms rather than moral ones. This paper argues that epistemic and moral blame for ignorance have fundamentally different normative foundations and violation conditions, with important implications for responsibility attribution practices. I develop a systematic framework for distinguishing these blame types by identifying their distinct normative bases: epistemic blame targets failures to meet truth-oriented obligations of inquiry and belief formation, while moral blame targets failures to meet care-oriented obligations regarding the welfare of others. Through analysis of cases ranging from professional negligence to everyday social interactions, I show that these blame types can diverge significantly - someone can be epistemically blameworthy but morally blameless, or vice versa. The distinction matters practically because it affects how we should respond to ignorance-based wrongdoing, what kinds of remedial measures are appropriate, and how we should structure institutions to promote both good believing and good acting. This framework resolves longstanding puzzles in the culpable ignorance literature about when and why ignorance excuses moral responsibility, and provides practical guidance for blame attribution in contexts from professional ethics to interpersonal relationships.",

# Skeptical Friend Analysis

## Abstract Claim Isolation

**CLAIM: "This paper develops diagnostic criteria for distinguishing epistemic from moral blame in ignorance cases by identifying their distinct normative foundations."**
PROMISE VS REALITY: Promises concrete, operational criteria but doesn't specify what these criteria actually are or how they work in practice. 4000 words might suffice if focused, but "diagnostic criteria" suggests systematic apparatus that needs substantial development.
VAGUENESS ISSUES: What exactly are "diagnostic criteria"? How do they operate? What makes them reliable?
VERDICT: Needs qualification - specify what kind of criteria and their scope

**CLAIM: "I argue that epistemic blame targets failures to meet truth-seeking obligations of inquiry and belief formation, while moral blame targets failures to meet care-based obligations regarding others' welfare."**
PROMISE VS REALITY: This is defensible as a core distinction, but "truth-seeking obligations" and "care-based obligations" need precise definition. The claim that these "can come apart" needs careful argument.
VAGUENESS ISSUES: What exactly are truth-seeking vs care-based obligations? How are their boundaries determined?
VERDICT: Defensible as-is but needs immediate clarification in paper

**CLAIM: "The key insight is that our conflicting intuitions about blame attribution in ignorance cases often result from tracking different normative violations simultaneously."**
PROMISE VS REALITY: This is a reasonable psychological/explanatory claim, but "often result from" is doing a lot of work. How often? What's the evidence?
VAGUENESS ISSUES: What counts as "conflicting intuitions"? Whose intuitions?
VERDICT: Needs qualification - "can result from" or "sometimes result from"

**CLAIM: "This analysis clarifies several puzzling features of culpable ignorance debates, particularly why ignorance sometimes seems to excuse moral responsibility and sometimes does not."**
PROMISE VS REALITY: "Several puzzling features" is promissory without specifics. "Clarifies" overstates what conceptual analysis can do.
VAGUENESS ISSUES: Which puzzling features? What kind of clarification?
VERDICT: Needs qualification - "helps explain" instead of "clarifies"

**CLAIM: "The diagnostic criteria I develop provide philosophers with concrete tools for analyzing responsibility attribution in ignorance cases and have practical significance for understanding appropriate responses to professional failures."**
PROMISE VS REALITY: "Concrete tools" oversells what a 4000-word conceptual analysis can deliver. "Practical significance" is vague hand-waving.
VAGUENESS ISSUES: What makes the tools "concrete"? What specific practical significance?
VERDICT: Fatally flawed - massively overstates deliverables

## Pattern Detection Results

☑ **Overreaching contribution claims**: "diagnostic criteria...provide philosophers with concrete tools" - this promises a systematic apparatus that would require extensive development and testing

☑ **Vague impact language**: "clarifies several puzzling features" and "practical significance" without specifying what features or what significance

☑ **Undefined core terminology**: "truth-seeking obligations" and "care-based obligations" are presented as if self-evident but need substantial theoretical development

☑ **Promissory notes without delivery plan**: The abstract promises diagnostic criteria but gives no indication of what they look like or how they operate

☑ **Scope inflation**: Claiming to address "culpable ignorance debates" generally plus professional contexts plus intuition explanation is too much for 4000 words

## Framework Alignment Issues

**Major misalignment**: The abstract promises "diagnostic criteria" but the key moves describe conceptual distinctions and explanatory frameworks. These are different kinds of philosophical work.

**Scope mismatch**: The thesis focuses on explaining conflicting intuitions, but the abstract promises tools for philosophers and practical significance for professional contexts.

**Contribution confusion**: Is this primarily explanatory (why we have conflicting intuitions) or normative (how we should attribute blame)? The abstract suggests both but that's two different papers.

# Summary Assessment

**MINOR REVISION NEEDED**

**MOST DAMAGING FLAW**: The abstract promises "concrete tools" and "diagnostic criteria" without specifying what these actually are or demonstrating that they can be developed in 4000 words. This reads like promising a systematic framework without space to deliver it.

## Next steps:

1. **Replace "diagnostic criteria" language** with "conceptual framework" or "theoretical distinction" - more honest about what's being delivered

2. **Cut the "concrete tools for philosophers" claim** - replace with "conceptual resources for understanding blame attribution"

3. **Qualify the scope**: Change "clarifies several puzzling features" to "helps explain why ignorance sometimes excuses and sometimes doesn't"

4. **Specify the core distinction immediately**: Give one sentence explaining what truth-seeking vs care-based obligations actually are

5. **Drop or drastically qualify practical significance claims** - either cut entirely or say "may have implications for" rather than claiming definite practical significance

The core idea is sound but the abstract oversells what can be delivered. With these changes, it becomes a defensible conceptual contribution rather than an overreaching systematic theory.

# Scratch Work

The moves show promise but have several concerning weaknesses. The core distinction between truth-seeking and care-based obligations is intuitively plausible but underdeveloped theoretically. The medical examples are effective but may be doing too much argumentative work - they illustrate practical separability but don't establish normative independence. The argument lacks sufficient engagement with potential objections, particularly the worry that these are just different aspects of professional competence rather than fundamentally distinct normative domains.

The integration between moves is reasonably good, but there's a gap between establishing practical separability and proving genuine normative independence. The framework promises "analytical criteria" but the developed moves focus more on establishing the distinction than providing systematic tools for applying it.

# Individual Move Analysis

## Move 1: Establishing Independent Normative Foundations

### Strengths
- Clear conceptual distinction between truth-seeking and care-based obligations
- Good use of value-based grounding (epistemic vs moral values)
- Sets up the entire analytical framework effectively

### Weaknesses
- Insufficient argument for why these constitute genuinely independent normative domains rather than interconnected aspects of rational agency
- Lacks engagement with potential unity objections (e.g., both serve broader goals of good judgment)
- The derivation from epistemic vs moral values is asserted rather than argued
- Missing consideration of hybrid cases where obligations might overlap or conflict

### Feasibility Issues
- Needs substantial theoretical development to establish independence claim convincingly
- Requires engagement with literature on epistemic vs moral normativity that may not be available
- Risk of spending too much space on foundational arguments at expense of practical application

### Recommendation
Major revision needed - must strengthen independence argument and address unity objections

## Move 2: Medical Professional Examples

### Strengths
- Concrete, intuitive illustrations of the distinction
- Professional context makes practical stakes clear
- Examples effectively show practical separability
- Dr. Chen and Dr. Wright cases are well-constructed contrasts

### Weaknesses
- Examples may conflate professional competence with fundamental normative obligations
- Risk of confusing domain-specific duties with general epistemic/moral obligations
- Medical context involves complex interactions that may obscure rather than clarify basic distinction
- Examples don't address whether this separability exists outside professional contexts

### Feasibility Issues
- Well-developed examples could consume significant word count
- May need additional examples to show generalizability beyond medical context
- Professional duty complications may require extensive clarification

### Recommendation
Minor refinement needed - strengthen connection to general obligations and consider scope

## Move 3: Practical Independence Through Professional Cases

### Strengths
- Systematic demonstration that obligations can come apart
- Clear progression from Dr. Chen (epistemic success/moral failure) to Dr. Wright (reverse)
- Effective use of contrast cases

### Weaknesses
- Focuses on descriptive separability without establishing normative independence
- Professional contexts involve special obligations that may not generalize
- Doesn't address whether apparent independence reflects measurement issues rather than genuine distinctness
- Missing consideration of cases where obligations align or reinforce each other

### Feasibility Issues
- Needs careful development to avoid confusion between professional and general obligations
- May require additional theoretical work to establish significance of practical separability
- Risk of overgeneralizing from professional contexts

### Recommendation
Minor refinement needed - clarify relationship between professional and general obligations

## Move 4: Normative Independence Argument

### Strengths
- Attempts to establish deeper theoretical foundation beyond practical separability
- Connects to different evaluative standards and justifications
- Important for distinguishing genuine independence from mere practical contingency

### Weaknesses
- Argument is underdeveloped and largely assertive
- Doesn't engage with potential objections about underlying unity of rational/moral agency
- Lacks sufficient detail about what "different standards and justifications" actually means
- Missing consideration of whether independence is compatible with systematic interaction

### Feasibility Issues
- Requires substantial theoretical development that may exceed word count constraints
- Needs engagement with literature on normative foundations that may not be available
- Complex philosophical terrain that's difficult to navigate convincingly in limited space

### Recommendation
Major revision needed - either develop more thoroughly or replace with different approach

## Move 5: Connection to Blame Attribution

### Strengths
- Directly connects theoretical distinction to practical blame judgments
- Explains conflicting intuitions as tracking different normative violations
- Sets up framework application effectively

### Weaknesses
- Connection between obligation types and blame types needs more development
- Doesn't address whether blame attribution differences might reflect other factors
- Missing consideration of cases where both blame types might be appropriate
- Lacks sufficient detail about how blame attribution actually works in practice

### Feasibility Issues
- Bridge between normative theory and blame practice needs careful development
- May require more space than allocated to establish connection convincingly
- Needs integration with existing blame theory literature

### Recommendation
Minor refinement needed - strengthen connection and add more detail

# Overall Assessment

## Integration Analysis
The moves work together reasonably well as a progressive argument, moving from theoretical distinction through practical illustration to blame attribution. However, there's a concerning gap between establishing practical separability (which the examples do effectively) and proving genuine normative independence (which remains underdeveloped). The argumentative progression assumes rather than establishes that practical separability implies normative independence.

## Framework Alignment
The moves address the framework's core commitments but incompletely. They establish a distinction between obligation types and provide some analytical tools, but the "specific analytical criteria" promised in the abstract are underdeveloped. The core contribution of providing "analytical tools for distinguishing epistemic from moral blame" is partially fulfilled but needs more systematic development.

## Critical Gaps
- Insufficient argument for genuine normative independence vs practical separability
- Underdeveloped analytical criteria for systematic application
- Limited engagement with potential objections and alternative explanations
- Missing consideration of hybrid cases and systematic interactions
- Lack of generalization beyond professional contexts
- Insufficient connection to existing literature on epistemic vs moral normativity

# Summary Recommendation

MAJOR REVISIONS

The moves establish an intuitively plausible distinction and provide effective illustrations, but the theoretical foundation is underdeveloped and the practical application tools are insufficient. The argument for normative independence needs strengthening, the analytical criteria need systematic development, and the framework needs better integration with existing literature. The medical examples are helpful but may be doing too much work - the argument needs stronger theoretical grounding that doesn't depend entirely on professional case intuitions.

Key revisions needed:
1. Strengthen argument for normative independence beyond practical separability
2. Develop systematic analytical criteria more thoroughly  
3. Address unity objections and alternative explanations
4. Expand beyond professional contexts to establish generalizability
5. Better integrate with existing literature on blame and normativity

# Scratch Work

The developed key move establishes the foundation for the entire framework by distinguishing truth-seeking from care-based obligations. The argument structure is clear and the physician examples are well-chosen to illustrate practical separability. However, there are several concerning weaknesses.

The most significant issue is that the argument doesn't adequately establish the "independent normative foundations" claim that's central to the thesis. Simply stating that truth-seeking obligations derive from epistemic values while care-based obligations derive from moral values isn't sufficient - many philosophers would argue these are interconnected rather than independent domains. The paper needs stronger argumentation for why these constitute genuinely separate normative territories rather than different aspects of broader rational/moral agency.

The examples are compelling but may be doing too much work. The physician cases clearly show practical separability, but practical separability doesn't necessarily entail normative independence. Someone could maintain that good epistemic practice includes moral considerations (truth-seeking should involve considering who might be harmed by one's beliefs/actions) or that good moral practice includes epistemic requirements (caring for others requires accurate beliefs about their interests).

The move also doesn't adequately address potential counterarguments or competing frameworks. Many virtue epistemologists would reject the clean separation between epistemic and moral domains. The argument needs to engage with views that see epistemic virtues as inherently moral or that ground epistemic obligations in broader social/moral considerations.

# Individual Move Analysis

## Move 1: Distinguishing Truth-Seeking from Care-Based Obligations

### Strengths
- Clear conceptual distinction between obligation types
- Compelling physician examples that illustrate practical separability
- Systematic enumeration of what each obligation type requires
- Good connection to blame attribution practices
- Examples are professionally relevant and intuitive

### Weaknesses
- Insufficient argumentation for "independent normative foundations" claim
- Doesn't adequately address virtue epistemology challenges to domain separation
- Risk of false dichotomy - many epistemic practices may inherently involve moral considerations
- Examples may conflate institutional/professional obligations with fundamental normative ones
- No engagement with views that ground epistemic obligations in moral considerations
- Unclear how to handle cases where truth-seeking itself serves moral ends

### Feasibility Issues
- Developing adequate defense of normative independence will require substantial space
- Need to address competing philosophical frameworks (virtue epistemology, social epistemology)
- Examples need more detailed development to show they're not just professional role conflicts
- Missing crucial step of showing why blame attributions track these specific distinctions

### Recommendation
Major revision needed - strengthen independence argument and address competing frameworks

# Overall Assessment

## Integration Analysis
The move provides a clear foundation for the framework, but its weaknesses could undermine the entire project. If the independence claim isn't adequately defended, then the distinction between epistemic and moral blame may collapse into different aspects of unified normative assessment. The physician examples work well together and would integrate effectively with later sections, but they need stronger theoretical backing.

The move connects appropriately to the literature (especially Boult's work on distinctive epistemic blame and Suni's attention mechanisms), but doesn't engage sufficiently with potential objections from virtue epistemology or social epistemology that would challenge the domain separation.

## Framework Alignment
The move directly supports the main thesis about distinct normative foundations, but the support is currently insufficient. The core contribution of developing analytical criteria depends on this foundational distinction being robust, so weaknesses here threaten the entire framework.

The move does advance the abstract's promise to explain conflicting intuitions by showing we track different violations, but this explanation only works if the violations are genuinely independent rather than interconnected aspects of broader normative assessment.

## Critical Gaps
- Inadequate defense of normative independence vs. interconnection
- No engagement with virtue epistemology challenges
- Missing argument for why blame attributions track these specific distinctions
- Need stronger theoretical grounding beyond practical separability
- Insufficient consideration of cases where domains overlap or conflict

# Summary Recommendation

MAJOR REVISIONS

The foundational move is conceptually sound and uses effective examples, but requires significant strengthening of the independence argument. The paper cannot succeed without robust defense of the claim that epistemic and moral obligations have genuinely independent normative foundations. This requires engaging with competing philosophical frameworks and providing stronger theoretical argumentation beyond practical separability examples.

The physician cases should be retained as they effectively illustrate the distinction, but they need to be supplemented with more fundamental argumentation about the nature of epistemic versus moral normativity. The move also needs to address how the framework handles cases where truth-seeking and care-based considerations conflict or converge.

# Scratch Work

The developed key moves show promise but have several significant weaknesses that need addressing. The foundational distinction between truth-seeking and care-based obligations is conceptually sound but needs stronger normative grounding. The physician examples are compelling but risk oversimplifying complex professional cases. The argument structure is logical but some moves lack sufficient development for a 4,000-word paper.

Key concerns: The independence claim needs more rigorous defense, the examples may be too narrow, and the connection to existing literature could be stronger. The moves work together conceptually but need better integration with the broader philosophical landscape.

# Individual Move Analysis

## Move 1: Establish Independent Normative Foundations
### Strengths
- Clear conceptual distinction between truth-seeking and care-based obligations
- Identifies distinct value sources (epistemic vs moral values)
- Sets up foundation for entire framework

### Weaknesses
- Normative independence claim needs stronger philosophical argument
- Doesn't adequately address potential reducibility objections
- Limited engagement with existing work on epistemic vs moral normativity
- Risk of false dichotomy - many obligations might be hybrid

### Feasibility Issues
- Establishing genuine normative independence requires substantial philosophical work
- Need to address counterarguments about unified normative foundations
- Must engage with literature on epistemic normativity that isn't fully covered

### Recommendation
Major revision needed - strengthen normative argument and address reducibility concerns

## Move 2: Develop Analytical Criteria
### Strengths
- Provides concrete operational tools for distinguishing obligation types
- Makes abstract distinction practically applicable
- Addresses core contribution promise of "analytical criteria"

### Weaknesses
- Criteria lists are somewhat mechanical and incomplete
- Doesn't address borderline or hybrid cases adequately
- Limited discussion of how to apply criteria when they conflict
- Examples of criteria application are underdeveloped

### Feasibility Issues
- Developing robust criteria requires extensive case analysis
- Need to test criteria against diverse examples
- Must show criteria are both necessary and sufficient

### Recommendation
Major revision needed - develop more nuanced criteria and application guidelines

## Move 3: Medical Professional Cases
### Strengths
- Concrete, relatable examples that illustrate the distinction clearly
- Shows practical separability of obligation types
- Dr. Chen and Dr. Wright cases are well-constructed contrasts

### Weaknesses
- Limited to single professional domain may weaken generalizability claims
- Cases might be too clean/artificial - real cases often messier
- Doesn't adequately address how professionals might meet both obligations
- Risk of stereotyping or oversimplifying medical ethics

### Feasibility Issues
- Need additional cases from other domains for generalizability
- Must address complexity of real professional scenarios
- Should include cases where obligations align, not just conflict

### Recommendation
Minor refinement needed - add complexity and breadth while maintaining clarity

## Move 4: Explain Conflicting Intuitions
### Strengths
- Addresses central puzzle motivating the paper
- Shows practical value of the framework
- Connects to broader philosophical debates about responsibility

### Weaknesses
- Doesn't provide sufficient empirical evidence for intuition conflicts
- Limited analysis of why we track different violations simultaneously
- Needs stronger connection to existing literature on moral psychology
- Risk of just-so story without adequate support

### Feasibility Issues
- Proving intuition patterns requires empirical or extensive case work
- Need to show framework actually resolves rather than explains away conflicts
- Must demonstrate superiority over alternative explanations

### Recommendation
Major revision needed - provide stronger evidence for intuition patterns and resolution

## Move 5: Apply to Literature Puzzles
### Strengths
- Shows broader theoretical significance beyond immediate framework
- Demonstrates engagement with existing debates
- Provides validation of framework's explanatory power

### Weaknesses
- Application feels rushed and underdeveloped in current form
- Limited selection of literature puzzles addressed
- Doesn't adequately show how framework improves on existing approaches
- Risk of retrofitting rather than genuine explanation

### Feasibility Issues
- Requires deep engagement with multiple literature debates
- Must show genuine improvement over existing approaches
- Need to select most compelling puzzle cases for limited word count

### Recommendation
Minor refinement needed - focus on strongest application cases and develop more thoroughly

# Overall Assessment

## Integration Analysis
The moves work together conceptually - each builds on the foundation established by the normative distinction. However, the progression feels somewhat mechanical rather than organic. Move 1 needs to be much stronger since everything depends on it. Moves 2-3 work well together but need better connection to Move 4. Move 5 feels disconnected and underdeveloped.

The biggest integration issue is that Move 1's independence claim isn't sufficiently established to support the weight the other moves place on it. If that foundation is shaky, the whole framework becomes questionable.

## Framework Alignment
The moves do support the thesis about distinct normative foundations, but not as strongly as needed. The core contribution of "analytical criteria" is addressed but underdeveloped. The abstract's promises are mostly met but several key claims need stronger support.

The moves align with the paper structure but don't take full advantage of the available literature for support and contrast. Better integration with Boult's relationship framework and Suni's attention mechanisms could strengthen multiple moves.

## Critical Gaps
- Insufficient defense of normative independence claim
- Limited empirical support for intuition conflict patterns  
- Underdeveloped criteria application guidelines
- Weak connection to existing epistemological debates
- Missing discussion of hybrid cases and borderline scenarios
- Inadequate response to potential reductionist objections

# Summary Recommendation

MAJOR REVISIONS

The moves show conceptual promise and the physician examples are compelling, but several fundamental issues need addressing:

1. **Strengthen Move 1**: The normative independence claim requires much more rigorous philosophical argument and engagement with potential objections.

2. **Develop Move 2**: The analytical criteria need to be more sophisticated and tested against diverse cases.

3. **Expand Move 3**: While the medical cases work well, need broader examples and more complex scenarios.

4. **Support Move 4**: The intuition explanation needs empirical grounding or more systematic case analysis.

5. **Focus Move 5**: Better integration with existing literature and more selective application to strongest cases.

The framework has potential but needs significant development to meet publication standards. The core insight about tracking different violations simultaneously is valuable, but the execution needs substantial improvement.
