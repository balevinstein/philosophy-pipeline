# Scratch Work
The critique suggests focusing on:
1. Methodological clarity in pattern recognition
2. Evaluation criteria specificity
3. Scope of virtue discussion
4. Move integration bridges

Key considerations:
- Must maintain strong grounding in Pritchard's framework
- Pattern recognition needs explicit criteria while staying manageable
- Virtue discussion should focus specifically on testimony
- Changes must work within available literature support
- Word count constraints require careful scoping

# Refinement Decisions

## Will Implement

1. Add explicit pattern recognition criteria in Move 1
- Draws directly from Chalmers/Jackson methodology
- Creates clear foundation for case analysis
- Manageable within space constraints

2. Tighten virtue discussion scope in Move 1
- Focus specifically on testimonial virtue conditions
- Ground in Pritchard's framework
- Reduce theoretical overhead

3. Add structured evaluation framework bridging Moves 1-2
- Clear criteria for distinguishing luck types
- Explicit connection to safety conditions
- Supports systematic case analysis

4. Enhance case methodology structure in Move 2
- Single medical case with controlled variants
- Explicit mapping to theoretical criteria
- Clear pattern extraction process

## Won't Implement

1. Expanded testimony literature engagement
- Limited by available literature
- Core framework from Pritchard sufficient
- Would expand scope too much

2. Detailed virtue theory development
- Beyond scope needed for luck distinction
- Would detract from core contribution
- Space constraints prohibitive

# Updated Move Development

## Move 1: Theoretical Foundations
- Begin with Pritchard's safety/virtue framework
- Develop safety conditions with explicit criteria:
  - Modal robustness criteria for transmission
  - Source reliability patterns for content
  - Systematic distinction markers
- Pattern recognition framework:
  - Feature identification criteria
  - Systematic variation principles
  - Clear paradigm case structure
- Focused virtue requirements:
  - Testimonial-specific conditions
  - Direct connection to luck types
  - Limited theoretical overhead

## Move 2: Case Methodology
- Structured case development:
  - Medical diagnosis base case
  - Systematic condition variations
  - Explicit mapping to theoretical criteria
- Pattern analysis framework:
  - Feature extraction protocol
  - Comparison methodology
  - Clear classification criteria
- Integration bridges:
  - Explicit theoretical connections
  - Pattern recognition application
  - Framework development links

# Change Notes

Theoretical Foundations:
- Maintains strong grounding in Pritchard
- Adds methodological precision
- Focuses virtue discussion appropriately

Move Interactions:
- Stronger bridges between moves
- Clear progression of analysis
- Explicit pattern recognition thread

Literature Integration:
- Focused use of Pritchard's framework
- Clear application of Chalmers/Jackson methodology
- Appropriate scope of engagement

Framework Alignment:
- Enhanced support for luck type distinction
- Maintained theoretical coherence
- Clear development path

Development Feasibility:
- Manageable within word constraints
- Clear structure for each section
- Appropriate technical depth

Dependencies:
- Move 2 builds clearly on Move 1 criteria
- Pattern analysis spans moves systematically
- Framework synthesis well-supported

The refinements strengthen methodological clarity and move integration while maintaining appropriate scope and theoretical grounding.
