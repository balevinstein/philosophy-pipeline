## Literature Synthesis

The papers represent two crucial perspectives on conceptual analysis. Quine's "Two Dogmas" presents fundamental challenges to traditional conceptual analysis through its critique of analyticity and meaning, while Chalmers and Jackson offer sophisticated tools for conducting conceptual analysis without requiring explicit definitions. These works together frame key methodological challenges and opportunities for our framework.

## Key Arguments and Moves

* **Quinean Challenges**: Must address how different types of conceptual analysis can proceed without assuming a strong analytic/synthetic distinction
* **Application Conditionals**: Can adapt Chalmers and Jackson's approach to show how different types of analysis succeed without complete definitions
* **Holistic Considerations**: Need to balance acknowledgment of meaning interconnections with practical analytical distinctions

## Development Strategy

1. Begin by acknowledging Quinean challenges while positioning our framework as a practical response
2. Use Chalmers and Jackson's methodological insights to develop criteria for successful analysis
3. Develop distinct success criteria for descriptive versus revisionary analysis
4. Show how framework accommodates semantic holism while maintaining useful distinctions

## Critical Points

* How different types of analysis can succeed without requiring traditional analyticity
* Relationship between implicit and explicit analysis in both descriptive and revisionary approaches
* Balance between acknowledging holistic meaning and maintaining practical distinctions

## Risks and Challenges

* Risk of framework appearing to ignore Quinean concerns
* Challenge of maintaining clear distinctions while acknowledging interconnections
* Need to avoid oversimplification while keeping framework practical

## Additional Notes and Observations

* Unexpected connection between Chalmers/Jackson's defense of non-definitional analysis and our need to distinguish analysis types
* Potential to use application conditionals as model for different success criteria
* Both papers suggest importance of methodology over strict definitions

## Next Stage Preparation

1. Develop clear statement of how framework addresses Quinean concerns
2. Create distinct methodological criteria for each type of analysis
3. Prepare examples showing framework's practical application
4. Structure argument to show how framework bridges theoretical challenges and practical needs

The next stage should focus on explicit development of how our framework can maintain useful distinctions while acknowledging and addressing fundamental challenges to conceptual analysis.
