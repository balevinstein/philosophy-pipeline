    "content": "# Scratch Work\nThe framework shows strong potential in distinguishing types of conceptual analysis while engaging key literature challenges. Main strengths are its practical orientation and clear theoretical contribution. Key areas for development include strengthening the connection to Quinean concerns and clarifying success criteria.\n\n# Abstract Analysis\n- Strong overall structure introducing problem, solution, and contribution\n- Well-balanced between theoretical and practical significance\n- Good engagement with literature context\n- Could strengthen preview of specific criteria\n- Consider foregrounding methodology more explicitly\n\nSuggested refinement: Add brief mention of specific criteria types that will be developed.\n\n# Framework Components Analysis\n\n## Main Thesis\nStrengths:\n- Clear and focused\n- Well-scoped for paper length\n- Good alignment with abstract\n\nRefinements needed:\n- Specify relationship between criteria types\n- Clarify how criteria interact\n\n## Core Contribution\nStrengths:\n- Balances theoretical and practical value\n- Clear distinction from existing work\n- Well-aligned with abstract\n\nRefinements needed:\n- Strengthen novelty claim\n- Clarify relationship to existing frameworks\n\n## Key Moves\nStrengths:\n- Logical progression\n- Clear connection to thesis\n- Feasible scope\n\nAreas for development:\n- Add more detail on criteria development\n- Strengthen case study integration\n- Clarify decision framework structure\n\n## Development Notes\nStrengths:\n- Realistic scope\n- Clear focus areas\n- Good literature engagement\n\nConcerns:\n- Case study selection needs more justification\n- Success criteria development could be challenging\n- May need more explicit Quinean engagement\n\n# Validation Assessment\n- Scope appropriate: YES - Well-focused for 4,000 words\n- Clearly articulated: YES - Framework components align well\n- Sufficiently original: YES - Novel distinction with practical application\n- Feasibly developable: YES - Clear development path with available resources\n\n# Improvement Recommendations\n1. Abstract:\n- Add brief mention of specific criteria types\n- Strengthen methodology focus\n\n2. Main Thesis:\n- Clarify relationships between criteria types\n- Strengthen distinction claims\n\n3. Key Moves:\n- Add detail on criteria development process\n- Strengthen case study justification\n\n4. Development Notes:\n- Expand Quinean engagement strategy\n- Clarify success criteria development approach\n\n# Summary Assessment\nMINOR REFINEMENT\n\nThe framework is fundamentally sound with good alignment between components. Main needs are:\n1. Stronger specification of criteria relationships\n2. Clearer case study justification\n3. More explicit Quinean engagement\n\nThe abstract and framework show strong potential and require only minor adjustments to achieve their aims. The scope is appropriate for the word limit and available resources.\n\nKey strengths to preserve:\n- Balance of theoretical/practical contribution\n- Clear development pathway\n- Strong literature engagement\n\nFocus refinements on strengthening methodological clarity while maintaining current scope and structure.",
