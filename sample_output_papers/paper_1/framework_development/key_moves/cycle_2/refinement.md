# Scratch Work
- Core critique suggests maintaining fundamental structure while tightening connections
- Main areas needing attention: scope management, theoretical grounding, and move transitions
- Must balance stronger Quinean engagement with practical focus
- Literature support adequate but needs more explicit integration
- Space constraints require careful prioritization

# Refinement Decisions

## Will Implement

1. Tighten corpus analysis scope in Move 1
- Focus specifically on methodologically relevant aspects
- Preserve theoretical connection while reducing technical detail

2. Strengthen Quinean engagement in theoretical foundation
- More explicit connection between meaning holism and criteria development
- Better integration with Chalmers/Jackson framework

3. Add explicit bridging sections between moves
- Clear theoretical progression
- Maintain framework coherence

4. Limit case study scope in application section
- Focus on knowledge attribution example
- More detailed theoretical grounding

## Won't Implement

1. Expand contemporary debates discussion
- Would exceed space constraints
- Core theoretical foundation sufficient

2. Additional success metrics
- Current criteria adequately cover key dimensions
- Additional metrics would dilute focus

# Updated Move Development

## Move 1: Establish Explicit Evaluative Criteria
1. Quinean Foundation
- Meaning holism implications for criteria development
- Connection to verification theory critique
- Framework response through conditional analysis

2. Success Metrics
Linguistic Alignment:
- Focused corpus analysis (key usage patterns)
- Expert consensus evaluation
- Systematic deviation tracking

Theoretical Fertility:
- Problem resolution capacity
- Research program potential
- Theoretical integration

[Bridge: From Theory to Application]
- Criteria as practical tools
- Implementation principles

## Move 2: Historical Context
- Targeted Quinean challenges
- Chalmers/Jackson response framework
- Contemporary application potential

[Bridge: Historical Lessons to Current Practice]
- Pattern of framework responses
- Practical implications

## Moves 3-4: Application
- Knowledge attribution case study
- Explicit criteria application
- Theoretical grounding in Chalmers/Jackson
- Clear success evaluation

# Change Notes

Theoretical Foundations:
- Stronger Quinean integration maintains philosophical rigor
- Better connection between theory and practice
- Clearer progression through framework

Move Interactions:
- Added bridges improve flow
- Tighter theoretical connections throughout
- More cohesive development

Literature Integration:
- More explicit engagement with primary sources
- Better use of Chalmers/Jackson framework
- Clear support for methodological moves

Framework Alignment:
- Changes strengthen core thesis support
- Maintain distinction between analysis types
- Better practical guidance integration

Development Feasibility:
- Tightened scope ensures space compliance
- Focused case study more developable
- Bridges add clarity without excessive length

Dependencies:
- Clearer progression from theory to practice
- Better support between moves
- Stronger methodological foundation

The refinements maintain the framework's strengths while addressing key weaknesses, particularly in theoretical grounding and move transitions. The changes stay within space constraints while improving overall coherence and practical utility.
