# Scratch Work

Initial observations:
- The moves build progressively from theoretical foundation to practical application
- Strong connection to literature through Quinean challenges and methodological developments
- Clear progression from criteria establishment to demonstration
- Potential tension between theoretical rigor and practical applicability

Dependencies:
- Success criteria must be established before application principles
- Case studies depend on clear criteria development
- Practical guidance requires solid theoretical foundation

# Move Analysis

## Move 1: Establish Explicit Evaluative Criteria
- Argument Assessment:
  * Strong theoretical grounding in distinguishing analysis types
  * Clear connection to main thesis
  * Criteria appear operationalizable
  * Could benefit from more explicit connection to Quinean challenges

- Development Feasibility:
  * Achievable within word limit (~800 words)
  * Clear development path through criteria specification
  * May need tighter scoping of "methodological transparency"

- Literature Support:
  * Can leverage Chalmers/Jackson's work on non-definitional analysis
  * Needs explicit engagement with Quine's holism concerns
  * Good foundation for building practical criteria

- Integration:
  * Sets up framework for subsequent moves
  * Clear connection to case studies
  * Supports practical guidance development

Recommendations:
1. Strengthen explicit connection to Quinean challenges
2. Tighten scope of methodological transparency criteria
3. Add specific metrics for each criterion

## Move 2: Historical Debate Analysis
- Argument Assessment:
  * Good connection to literature
  * Clear relevance to framework
  * Risk of becoming too historical/broad

- Development Feasibility:
  * May need tighter focus to fit space constraints
  * Consider reducing number of examples
  * Clear development path through selected cases

- Literature Support:
  * Well-supported by provided papers
  * Could use stronger connection to Chalmers/Jackson methodology

- Integration:
  * Supports main thesis
  * Provides context for criteria
  * May need tighter connection to practical guidance

Recommendations:
1. Focus on fewer, more detailed examples
2. Strengthen connection to methodological framework
3. Ensure historical analysis serves practical aims

## Moves 3 & 4: Case Studies and Practical Procedures
- Argument Assessment:
  * Good balance of theory and practice
  * Clear connection to criteria
  * May need more explicit success metrics

- Development Feasibility:
  * Reasonable scope for case studies
  * Clear implementation path
  * May need to prioritize certain aspects

- Literature Support:
  * Can use Chalmers/Jackson's application conditional approach
  * Need to show engagement with Quinean concerns

- Integration:
  * Strong connection to earlier moves
  * Supports practical aims
  * Good framework validation

Recommendations:
1. Develop specific success metrics
2. Prioritize most important practical guidance
3. Strengthen theoretical connections in case studies

# Cross-Cutting Considerations

Dependencies:
- Success criteria must be established before application
- Historical analysis should inform but not overshadow practical guidance
- Case studies must demonstrate both approaches clearly

Literature Coverage:
- Good use of available sources
- Need stronger integration of Quinean concerns throughout
- Could better leverage Chalmers/Jackson methodology

Framework Support:
- Moves generally support main thesis well
- Some tightening needed in connections between moves
- Good balance of theory and practice

# Summary Assessment
MINOR REFINEMENT

The key moves are fundamentally sound but need targeted improvements:
1. Strengthen theoretical foundations through explicit Quinean engagement
2. Tighten connections between moves
3. Develop more specific success metrics
4. Ensure historical analysis serves practical aims
5. Maintain focus on framework development over historical debate

Next steps should focus on developing specific success metrics while maintaining strong theoretical grounding. The framework appears viable within space constraints with suggested refinements.
