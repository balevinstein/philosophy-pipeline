# Scratch Work
Key considerations from critique:
- Need stronger Quinean engagement while maintaining practicality
- Success metrics require more specificity without becoming artificial
- Historical analysis needs tighter focus on framework development
- Case studies must demonstrate both approaches effectively
- Methodological transparency needs clearer scope

Dependencies:
- Quinean concerns affect all success criteria development
- Specific metrics must work for both analysis types
- Case study selection depends on criteria refinement
- Practical guidance relies on clear success metrics

# Refinement Decisions

## Will Implement
1. Add explicit Quinean integration in criteria development
- Shows how framework functions without strong analytic/synthetic distinction
- Addresses meaning holism while maintaining practical utility

2. Develop specific success metrics for each criterion
- Linguistic alignment: corpus analysis, expert surveys, usage patterns
- Theoretical fertility: problem-solving capacity, research program generation
- Methodological transparency: replicability standards, assumption documentation

3. Tighten methodological transparency scope
- Focus on process documentation and assumption clarity
- Remove broader epistemic considerations
- Keep aligned with practical framework goals

4. Strengthen Chalmers/Jackson methodology integration
- Use application conditionals to structure success criteria
- Show how framework extends their insights

## Won't Implement
1. Extensive historical analysis expansion
- Would dilute practical focus
- Space constraints prohibitive
- Core points achievable through targeted examples

2. Additional case studies
- Current knowledge attribution case sufficient
- Additional cases would strain word limit

# Updated Move Development

## Move 1: Establish Explicit Evaluative Criteria
1. Ground criteria in Quinean insights:
- Acknowledge meaning interdependence
- Show how criteria function without strict analyticity
- Demonstrate practical validity within holistic constraints

2. Specific success metrics:
Linguistic Alignment:
- Corpus analysis alignment score (0-1)
- Expert usage survey concordance
- Systematic deviation documentation

Theoretical Fertility:
- Problem resolution capacity
- Research program generation
- Integration potential score

Methodological Transparency:
- Process documentation completeness
- Assumption explicit statement
- Replication guidance clarity

## Move 2: Historical Context
Focused treatment showing:
- Traditional analysis limitations
- Quinean challenge significance
- Framework response demonstration
Limited to ~400 words

## Moves 3 & 4: Application
- Structure using Chalmers/Jackson application conditionals
- Demonstrate metric application
- Show practical implementation steps

# Change Notes
- Theoretical Foundations: Strengthened through explicit Quinean engagement
- Move Interactions: Tighter integration through consistent metrics
- Literature Integration: Enhanced use of both primary sources
- Framework Alignment: Maintained while adding specificity
- Development Feasibility: Refined scope keeps within word limits
- Dependencies: Clear progression from criteria to application

All changes maintain focus on main thesis while adding necessary rigor and specificity.
