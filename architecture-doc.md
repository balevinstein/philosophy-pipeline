# Phase II Architecture: Analysis Paper Development System

## Overview

This document describes the architecture for Phase II of the AI-driven philosophy paper generation system. Phase II takes output from Phase I (selected topic, literature requirements) and produces a detailed outline ready for Phase III (paper writing).

## Core Design Principles

1. **Intelligent Worker Management**: Leverage LLM capabilities while managing cognitive load through clear task boundaries
2. **Hierarchical Quality Control**: Local development with global oversight to maintain coherence and prevent drift
3. **Flexible Development**: Handle diverse philosophical content while maintaining systematic approach
4. **Literature Integration**: Strategic use of available sources with future enhancement path
5. **Managed Complexity**: Clear development cycles with appropriate validation stages
6. **Pragmatic Goals**: Target ~20% publication success rate through systematic development
7. **Forward Compatibility**: Design for future enhancements while maintaining MVP functionality

### Worker System

The pipeline uses an actor/critic/refinement pattern:

1. Worker develops content
2. Critic evaluates
3. Refinement worker implements improvements
4. Cycles repeat until satisfactory

Key principles:

- Clear task boundaries
- Managed cognitive load
- Framework alignment
- Quality validation
- Drift prevention

### II.3: Key Moves Development

This stage takes the blueprint from II.2 and fully develops each key argumentative
move while maintaining theoretical coherence and practical feasibility.

#### Core Objectives

- Develop key moves to near-final form
- Ensure arguments are logically sound
- Integrate examples and literature effectively
- Maintain alignment with framework
- Prevent conceptual drift

#### Worker Architecture

1. LocalMoveWorker

- Purpose: Develop individual key moves to full form
- Input: Single key move + full paper context (framework, outline, literature)
- Process:
  - Core argument development
  - Example integration
  - Literature connection
  - Feasibility assessment
- Output: Fully developed move with supporting elements

2. LocalCritic

- Purpose: Evaluate individual move development
- Focus areas:
  - Argument validity
  - Example effectiveness
  - Literature integration
  - Local coherence
  - Development completeness
- Output: Specific recommendations for improvement

3. LocalRefinementWorker

- Purpose: Implement critic recommendations
- Process:
  - Evaluate suggested changes
  - Maintain move integrity
  - Implement accepted improvements
- Output: Refined move development

4. GlobalCritic

- Purpose: Evaluate collective move development
- Focus areas:
  - Framework alignment
  - Inter-move coherence
  - Overall feasibility
  - Literature coverage
- Output: High-level recommendations

#### Development Flow

1. Initial Move Development

   - LocalMoveWorker processes each move
   - LocalCritic evaluates
   - LocalRefinement implements changes
   - Repeat until satisfactory

2. Global Review
   - GlobalCritic evaluates full set
   - LocalMoveWorker addresses issues
   - Repeat cycle if needed

#### Success Criteria

- Arguments fully developed with clear structure
- Examples effectively integrated
- Literature properly deployed
- Maintains framework alignment
- Feasible within space constraints
- Ready for outline integration

#### Quality Control

- Regular validation against framework
- Explicit tracking of changes
- Clear criteria for move completion
- Coherence checking between moves

This stage prioritizes getting core content right while maintaining manageable complexity and allowing for iteration where needed.

#### Move Type Handling

The LocalMoveWorker needs to handle diverse philosophical moves while maintaining development quality. Rather than assuming specific move types, the worker follows key principles:

Core Development Principles:

- Identify the move's fundamental argumentative goal
- Determine appropriate support needs (examples, cases, formal arguments)
- Establish clear success criteria based on move's purpose
- Select appropriate development strategy
- Maintain theoretical rigor while ensuring practical feasibility

The worker maintains flexibility through:

- Context-sensitive development approach
- Clear argument structure requirements
- Appropriate evidence selection
- Strategic literature deployment
- Regular validation against move's purpose

This approach allows handling both common move types (taxonomies, spectrums, methodologies) and novel argumentative strategies while ensuring development quality.

#### Worker Intelligence Management

The system leverages the workers' general intelligence and philosophical judgment while managing cognitive load:

Leveraging Capabilities:

- Natural understanding of argument types
- Ability to judge support needs
- Philosophical writing expertise
- Literature integration skills
- Quality assessment capacity

Managing Load:

- One move at a time
- Clear task boundaries
- Essential context only
- Explicit success criteria
- Structured review cycles

This approach allows workers to use their full capabilities while maintaining:

- Focus on specific tasks
- Framework alignment
- Development quality
- Systematic progress

### II.4: Detailed Outline Development

Takes the fully developed key moves from II.3 and creates a comprehensive outline that will guide Phase III writing.

#### Core Objectives

- Integrate developed moves into detailed structure
- Plan full section/subsection development
- Establish clear transitions and flow
- Maintain feasible scope

#### Worker Architecture

[Similar local/global pattern but focused on structural development]

#### Development Flow

1. Initial structural expansion
2. Move integration
3. Transition development
4. Feasibility validation

#### Success Criteria

- Clear development path for each section
- Proper space for move deployment
- Feasible within word constraints
- Ready for Phase III writing

### II.5: Integration and Smoothing [Optional]

This stage may be used if needed to handle any remaining integration issues after II.4.

#### Potential Objectives

- Final framework alignment check
- Move-structure integration issues
- Literature coverage gaps
- Last feasibility validation

This stage might prove unnecessary if II.3 and II.4 achieve sufficient development quality.
