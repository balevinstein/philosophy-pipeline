# AI-Driven Philosophy Paper Generator

A system that generates complete publishable-quality analytic philosophy papers through a structured multi-phase development pipeline.

## Project Overview

This project demonstrates that large language models can systematically develop philosophical papers suitable for academic publication. Targeting the journal Analysis (4,000-word limit), the system:

1. **Generates and evaluates** potential paper topics
2. **Develops detailed** argumentative frameworks with literature integration
3. **Creates structured** comprehensive outlines with key moves
4. **Produces complete** publication-ready draft papers
5. **Refines through** global analysis and integration

The goal is to achieve a ~20% success rate in generating publishable-quality papers while maintaining philosophical rigor and originality.

## Current Status

The full pipeline now generates complete philosophy papers from topic generation through final publication-ready drafts:

- âœ… **Phase I.1** (Topic Generation): Complete
- âœ… **Phase I.2** (Literature Research): Complete - find relevant literature on the web
- âœ… **Phase II.1** (Literature Processing): Complete - uses Claude's native PDF processing

## Configuration

Edit `config/conceptual_config.yaml` to adjust:

- **Iteration limits**: Max cycles per development phase
- **Model settings**: Provider, model, temperature per worker type
- **Content parameters**: Word counts, section allocations
- **Quality thresholds**: Assessment criteria and validation levels

## Performance Characteristics

- **Phase II.1**: ~5 minutes (literature processing)
- **Phase II.2**: ~10 minutes (framework development)
- **Phase II.3**: ~45 minutes (key moves development, 2 moves)
- **Phase II.4**: ~53 minutes (detailed outline with Analysis PDF integration)
- **Phase II.5**: ~2 minutes (context consolidation)
- **Phase II.6**: ~3 minutes (writing context preparation)
- **Phase III.1**: ~25 minutes (section-by-section writing with critique/refinement and Analysis style guidance)
- **Phase III.2**: ~2 minutes (global integration and final paper generation with Analysis publication standards)
- **Total Pipeline**: ~145 minutes for complete Analysis-style philosophy paper generation

### Model Usage

- **Primary Models**: Claude Sonnet 4 (upgraded from 3.5 for better quality)
- **Specialized Tasks**: OpenAI o1-preview for complex reasoning (Phase II development)
- **Token Efficiency**: Optimized prompts with targeted context for cost efficiency
- **Quality Control**: Multi-stage critique and refinement at section and paper levels

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Rivet server not running**: Phase II.5 requires `node server.js` in rivet directory
2. **Missing PDFs**: Download papers to `papers/` directory before Phase II.1
3. **API rate limits**: The pipeline respects rate limits but may take longer during high usage
4. **Virtual environment**: Always activate with `source venv/bin/activate`
5. **Phase III.1 context missing**: Ensure Phase II.6 completed successfully before running Phase III.1
6. **Final paper quality**: Phase III.2 requires Claude Sonnet 4; check config for correct model settings

### Getting Help

- Check `architecture-doc.md` for detailed system design
- Review configuration in `config/conceptual_config.yaml`
- Examine outputs in `outputs/` directory for debugging
- Look at `debug_integration_response.txt` if Phase III.2 has issues

## Contributing

The project has achieved **core functionality completion** with a working end-to-end pipeline. Current priorities for enhancement:

1. **Citation Accuracy**: Implement fact-checking and citation verification systems
2. **Prompt Optimization**: Fine-tune prompts for even higher quality philosophical content  
3. **Length Control**: Better word count targeting for different journal requirements
4. **Multiple Topics**: Expand testing across diverse philosophical domains
5. **Quality Metrics**: Develop automated assessment of philosophical rigor and originality

## Academic Goals & Current Achievement

**Target**: 20% publication success rate in generating papers suitable for analytic philosophy journals

**Current Status**: 
- âœ… **Infrastructure Complete**: Full pipeline operational from topic to publication-ready paper
- âœ… **Quality Demonstration**: Generated coherent, structured philosophical arguments
- âœ… **Professional Output**: Academic formatting, proper structure, theoretical rigor
- ðŸ”„ **Next Phase**: Citation accuracy and philosophical depth optimization

The pipeline demonstrates that **systematic LLM-driven philosophical research is feasible** with appropriate architecture and quality control mechanisms.
