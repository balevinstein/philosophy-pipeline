# AI-Driven Philosophy Paper Generator

A system that generates complete publishable-quality analytic philosophy papers through a structured multi-phase development pipeline.

## Project Overview

This project demonstrates that large language models can systematically develop philosophical papers suitable for academic publication. Targeting the journal Analysis (4,000-word limit), the system:

1. **Generates and evaluates** potential paper topics
2. **Develops detailed** argumentative frameworks with literature integration
3. **Creates structured** comprehensive outlines with key moves
4. **Produces complete** publication-ready draft papers
5. **Refines through** global analysis and integration

The goal is to achieve a ~20% success rate in generating publishable-quality papers while maintaining philosophical rigor and originality.

## Current Status

**ðŸŽ‰ COMPLETE END-TO-END PIPELINE WORKING!** 

The full pipeline now generates complete philosophy papers from topic generation through final publication-ready drafts:

- âœ… **Phase I.1** (Topic Generation): Complete
- âœ… **Phase I.2** (Literature Research): Complete - find relevant literature on the web
- âœ… **Phase II.1** (Literature Processing): Complete - uses Claude's native PDF processing
- âœ… **Phase II.2** (Framework Development): Complete - framework-driven paper development
- âœ… **Phase II.3** (Key Moves Development): Complete - sophisticated argument development
- âœ… **Phase II.4** (Detailed Outline Development): Complete - comprehensive outline with literature mapping
- âœ… **Phase II.5** (Context Consolidation): Complete - unified context for Phase III
- âœ… **Phase III.1** (Section-by-Section Writing): Complete - detailed section writing with critique and refinement
- âœ… **Phase III.2** (Global Integration): Complete - publication-ready paper with professional formatting

### Latest Achievements

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+
- Node.js (for Rivet server)
- API Keys:
  - Anthropic API key (required for all phases)
  - OpenAI API key
  - Tavily Search API key
- [Rivet](https://rivet.ironcladapp.com/) - Download and install the Rivet IDE

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/balevinstein/philosophy-pipeline.git
cd philosophy-pipeline
```

2. **Create and activate the virtual environment**

```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
```

To deactivate the virtual environment at any point:

```bash
deactivate
```

3. **Install dependencies**

In the root directory:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

In the `rivet` directory:

```bash
cd rivet
npm install
cd ..
```

4. **Create `.env` file with API keys in the root directory**

```bash
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your_anthropic_key_here
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_key_here
TAVILY_API_KEY=your_tavily_key_here
```

5. **Start Rivet server** (required for Phase II.5)

In a separate terminal:

```bash
cd rivet
node --watch server.js
```

Keep this running while using the pipeline.

## Running the Pipeline

### Quick Start: Complete End-to-End Pipeline

**Note**: This assumes you already have literature papers in the `papers/` directory. For a complete from-scratch run, start with the detailed instructions below.

Once you have literature papers in the `papers/` directory, you can run the complete pipeline to generate a finished philosophy paper:

```bash
# Activate virtual environment
source venv/bin/activate

# Run complete pipeline (takes ~105 minutes)
python run_phase_2_1.py  # Literature processing
python run_phase_2_2.py  # Framework development  
python run_phase_2_3.py  # Key moves development
python run_phase_2_4.py  # Detailed outline
python run_phase_2_5.py  # Context consolidation
python run_phase_2_6.py  # Writing context preparation
python run_phase_3_1.py  # Section-by-section writing

## Configuration

Edit `config/conceptual_config.yaml` to adjust:

- **Iteration limits**: Max cycles per development phase
- **Model settings**: Provider, model, temperature per worker type
- **Content parameters**: Word counts, section allocations
- **Quality thresholds**: Assessment criteria and validation levels

## Performance Characteristics

- **Phase II.1**: ~5 minutes (literature processing)
- **Phase II.2**: ~10 minutes (framework development)
- **Phase II.3**: ~45 minutes (key moves development, 2 moves)
- **Phase II.4**: ~15 minutes (detailed outline)
- **Phase II.5**: ~2 minutes (context consolidation)
- **Phase II.6**: ~3 minutes (writing context preparation)
- **Phase III.1**: ~20 minutes (section-by-section writing with critique/refinement)
- **Phase III.2**: ~5 minutes (global integration and final paper generation)
- **Total Pipeline**: ~105 minutes for complete philosophy paper generation

### Model Usage

- **Primary Models**: Claude Sonnet 4 (upgraded from 3.5 for better quality)
- **Specialized Tasks**: OpenAI o1-preview for complex reasoning (Phase II development)
- **Token Efficiency**: Optimized prompts with targeted context for cost efficiency
- **Quality Control**: Multi-stage critique and refinement at section and paper levels

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Rivet server not running**: Phase II.5 requires `node server.js` in rivet directory
2. **Missing PDFs**: Download papers to `papers/` directory before Phase II.1
3. **API rate limits**: The pipeline respects rate limits but may take longer during high usage
4. **Virtual environment**: Always activate with `source venv/bin/activate`
5. **Phase III.1 context missing**: Ensure Phase II.6 completed successfully before running Phase III.1
6. **Final paper quality**: Phase III.2 requires Claude Sonnet 4; check config for correct model settings

### Getting Help

- Check `architecture-doc.md` for detailed system design
- Review configuration in `config/conceptual_config.yaml`
- Examine outputs in `outputs/` directory for debugging
- Look at `debug_integration_response.txt` if Phase III.2 has issues

## Contributing

The project has achieved **core functionality completion** with a working end-to-end pipeline. Current priorities for enhancement:

1. **Citation Accuracy**: Implement fact-checking and citation verification systems
2. **Prompt Optimization**: Fine-tune prompts for even higher quality philosophical content  
3. **Length Control**: Better word count targeting for different journal requirements
4. **Multiple Topics**: Expand testing across diverse philosophical domains
5. **Quality Metrics**: Develop automated assessment of philosophical rigor and originality

## Academic Goals & Current Achievement

**Target**: 20% publication success rate in generating papers suitable for analytic philosophy journals

**Current Status**: 
- âœ… **Infrastructure Complete**: Full pipeline operational from topic to publication-ready paper
- âœ… **Quality Demonstration**: Generated coherent, structured philosophical arguments
- âœ… **Professional Output**: Academic formatting, proper structure, theoretical rigor
- ðŸ”„ **Next Phase**: Citation accuracy and philosophical depth optimization

The pipeline demonstrates that **systematic LLM-driven philosophical research is feasible** with appropriate architecture and quality control mechanisms.
