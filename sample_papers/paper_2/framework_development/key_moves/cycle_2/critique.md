# Scratch Work
The moves build from theoretical foundations through case methodology to framework development. Key dependencies:
- Case methodology requires clear theoretical criteria from Move 1
- Pattern analysis draws on both theoretical base and case methodology
- Framework synthesis relies on all prior moves

Core challenges:
- Balancing theoretical rigor with clear case analysis
- Maintaining distinct luck types while showing interaction
- Supporting claims with available literature
- Managing scope within space constraints

# Move Analysis

## Move 1: Theoretical Foundations
Argument Assessment:
- Strong grounding in Pritchard's framework
- Clear extension to testimonial domain
- Well-structured development of safety conditions
- Could strengthen virtue condition treatment

Development Feasibility:
+ Safety condition adaptation looks manageable
+ Clear literature support from Pritchard
- May need tighter scoping of virtue discussion 
- Pattern recognition approach needs more detail

Literature Support:
+ Pritchard provides core framework
+ Chalmers/Jackson methodology helpful
- Could use stronger testimony-specific grounding

Integration:
+ Sets up case methodology well
+ Provides criteria for framework
- Need clearer bridge to pattern analysis

Recommendations:
1. Tighten scope of virtue discussion
2. Strengthen pattern recognition methodology
3. Add explicit criteria for luck type distinction

## Move 2: Case Methodology
Argument Assessment:
+ Clear progression through variants
+ Systematic condition variation
- Could strengthen evaluation criteria
- Pattern extraction needs more detail

Development Feasibility:
+ Single case with variants is manageable
+ Clear structure for analysis
- May need more specific criteria
- Pattern recognition framework needs work

Literature Support:
+ Can draw on Pritchard's examples
+ Chalmers/Jackson approach useful
- Need stronger tie to testimony literature

Integration:
+ Builds well on theoretical base
+ Feeds into framework development
- Could strengthen pattern analysis bridge

Recommendations:
1. Develop more specific evaluation criteria
2. Strengthen pattern recognition framework
3. Add explicit ties to testimony literature

# Cross-Cutting Considerations

Dependencies:
- Move 2 relies heavily on Move 1's theoretical criteria
- Pattern analysis spans both moves
- Framework synthesis needs both well-developed

Literature Coverage:
+ Good use of Pritchard's framework
+ Methodological support from Chalmers/Jackson
- Could strengthen testimony-specific engagement

Framework Support:
+ Moves build coherently
+ Clear progression
- Some gaps in pattern analysis
- Need stronger synthesis bridges

# Summary Assessment
MINOR REFINEMENT

The core moves are fundamentally sound but need targeted improvements:
1. Strengthen pattern recognition methodology
2. Develop more specific evaluation criteria
3. Tighten scope of virtue discussion
4. Add explicit bridges between moves

The basic structure works well, building from theoretical foundations through case methodology to framework development. Key improvements focus on strengthening connections and making criteria more explicit while maintaining manageable scope.

Next steps:
1. Revise Move 1 to tighten virtue discussion and add explicit criteria
2. Enhance Move 2's evaluation framework
3. Strengthen pattern analysis spanning both moves
4. Add clear synthesis bridges

This should preserve the strong core while addressing key gaps in development.
