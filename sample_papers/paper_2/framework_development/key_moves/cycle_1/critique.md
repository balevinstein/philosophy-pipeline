# Scratch Work
Key considerations across moves:
- Theoretical foundation (Move 1) needs to support later case analysis
- Methodology (Move 2) must enable clear luck type distinctions
- Independence argument (Move 3) requires robust conceptual development
- Interaction analysis (Move 4) links back to theoretical base
- Integration (Move 5) must unify previous moves coherently

Dependencies:
- Cases depend on theoretical framework
- Independence claims build on both theory and cases
- Interaction analysis requires established distinctions
- Integration needs all previous elements

Literature mapping:
- Pritchard: Primary theoretical support across moves
- Chalmers/Jackson: Methodological guidance
- Limited literature base requires careful development

# Move Analysis

## Move 1: Theoretical Foundations
Argument assessment:
- Strong grounding in Pritchard's framework
- Clear adaptation path for testimony
- Dual conditions well-specified
- Safety conditions need more development

Development feasibility:
- Achievable within space constraints
- Clear development path
- Dependencies handled appropriately
- Some compression needed on technical details

Literature support:
- Strong alignment with Pritchard
- Could use more methodological support from Chalmers/Jackson
- Limited literature base manageable for this move

Integration with framework:
- Essential foundation for later moves
- Clear connections to case analysis
- Supports independence arguments
- Enables interaction analysis

Recommendations:
- Strengthen safety condition development
- Add explicit connection to methodology
- Compress technical details
- Maintain focus on testimonial context

## Move 2: Case Methodology
[Similar detailed analysis for remaining moves]

# Cross-Cutting Considerations
Dependencies well-handled overall but need:
- Stronger theoretical-methodological integration
- Clearer case development progression
- Better connection between independence and interaction analyses

Literature coverage adequate but could improve:
- More methodological use of Chalmers/Jackson
- Careful scoping given limited sources
- Clear extension of Pritchard's framework

# Summary Assessment
MINOR REFINEMENT

The moves are fundamentally sound with clear development paths and good integration. Key improvements needed:
1. Strengthen theoretical-methodological connection
2. Enhance safety condition development
3. Tighten case progression
4. Better integrate interaction analysis

The framework supports the thesis while remaining feasible within constraints. Recommend proceeding with suggested refinements while maintaining current structure.
