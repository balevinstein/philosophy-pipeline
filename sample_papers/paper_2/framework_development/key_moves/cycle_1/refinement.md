# Scratch Work
Key considerations from critique:
- Safety conditions need stronger development in Move 1
- Better theoretical-methodological integration needed
- Case progression could be tighter
- Interaction analysis needs better integration
- Limited literature must be used efficiently

Dependencies affected:
- Safety condition development impacts all subsequent moves
- Methodological integration affects case analysis credibility
- Case progression influences independence arguments
- Interaction analysis ties back to theoretical foundation

Theoretical implications:
- Must maintain strong connection to Pritchard's framework
- Need clear path from theory to methodology to cases
- Safety conditions must support both luck types distinctly
- Virtue requirements need clear differentiation

# Refinement Decisions

## Will Implement
1. Expand safety condition development in Move 1 -- Essential for later analysis and well-supported by Pritchard
2. Add explicit methodology bridge in Move 1 -- Strengthens theory-method connection using Chalmers/Jackson
3. Restructure case progression in Move 2 -- Creates clearer path through argument
4. Enhance interaction mechanism discussion in Move 4 -- Better connects to theoretical base

## Won't Implement
1. Further technical detail in Move 1 -- Would exceed space constraints
2. Additional case variants -- Would dilute core examples
3. Expanded virtue discussion -- Would compete with safety focus

# Updated Move Development

## Move 1: Theoretical Foundations
- Begin with Pritchard's safety/virtue framework
- Expanded safety condition development:
  - Local modal robustness for transmission
  - Source reliability patterns for content
  - Explicit distinction criteria
- Methodological bridge section:
  - Pattern recognition approach from Chalmers/Jackson
  - Application to luck type distinction
- Connect to case analysis framework

## Move 2: Case Methodology 
- Restructured case progression:
  - Single medical case with variants
  - Systematic variation of conditions
  - Clear pattern extraction
- Enhanced evaluation criteria
- Explicit theoretical connections

[Moves 3-5 remain largely unchanged but with tightened connections]

# Change Notes
- Theoretical foundations: Strengthened while maintaining scope
- Move interactions: Better connected through methodology bridge
- Literature integration: More efficient use of Chalmers/Jackson
- Framework alignment: Maintained with clearer progression
- Development feasibility: Preserved through focused changes
- Dependencies: Clearer connections between moves

The refinements strengthen the theoretical foundation and methodological approach while maintaining feasibility within constraints. The enhanced safety condition development and methodology bridge provide better support for subsequent moves without requiring major restructuring.
