# Scratch Work
- Main critique suggests need for stronger cognitive mechanism analysis & more testimonial focus
- Must balance adding detail vs space constraints
- Need to ensure changes maintain tight connection to Pritchard's framework
- Consider how strengthening theoretical foundation impacts later moves
- Evaluate which case additions provide most value
- Assess feasibility of cognitive mechanism development given literature constraints

# Refinement Decisions

## Will Implement

1. Add explicit safety condition adaptation for testimony in Move 1
- Directly supported by Pritchard
- Essential foundation for later analysis
- Clear development path within constraints

2. Strengthen modal analysis in Move 3
- Core to distinguishing luck types
- Well-supported by literature 
- Manageable scope addition

3. Add focused testimonial examples in Move 2
- Medical testimony case shows both luck types clearly
- Legal testimony example demonstrates independence
- Keeps scope controlled while strengthening relevance

4. Clarify evaluation criteria in methodology section
- Builds on Chalmers/Jackson approach
- Improves framework cohesion
- Essential for systematic analysis

## Won't Implement

1. Extensive cognitive mechanism analysis
- Insufficient literature support
- Risk of scope creep
- Not essential for core argument

2. Broad practical applications
- Would dilute theoretical focus
- Space constraints
- Better as future work

3. Additional assessment tools
- Beyond core theoretical contribution
- Space limitations
- Not essential for main thesis

# Updated Move Development

## Move 1: Theoretical Foundations
- Begin with Pritchard's safety/virtue framework
- Add explicit adaptation for testimonial knowledge:
  - Transmission safety: Local modal robustness
  - Content safety: Source reliability conditions
- Show how dual-conditions manifest distinctly in testimony
- Connect to later case analysis

## Move 2: Case Methodology 
- Present controlled variation approach
- Introduce core testimonial cases:
  - Medical diagnosis transmission/content variants
  - Legal testimony reliability/truth variants
- Establish evaluation criteria based on modal profiles
- Link to theoretical framework

## Move 3: Conceptual Independence
- Enhanced modal analysis showing distinct profiles
- Demonstrate intervention point independence
- Show different virtue condition requirements
- Support with case applications

## Move 4: Interaction Analysis
- Focus on theoretical interaction patterns
- Show how safety conditions combine
- Demonstrate virtue requirement relationships
- Limited mechanism discussion within literature constraints

## Move 5: Framework Integration
- Synthesize theoretical elements
- Show explanatory power through cases
- Focus on theoretical implications
- Brief practical relevance notes

# Change Notes

Theoretical Foundations:
- Strengthened by explicit safety condition adaptation
- Maintains tight connection to Pritchard
- Better supports later moves

Move Interactions:
- Enhanced theoretical foundation improves later analysis
- Clearer methodology supports case development
- More focused interaction analysis

Literature Integration:
- Better use of Pritchard's framework
- Appropriate use of Chalmers/Jackson
- Stays within available sources

Framework Alignment:
- Maintains focus on main thesis
- Stronger theoretical grounding
- Clear development path

Feasibility:
- Changes respect word limit
- Development paths clear
- Reasonable scope

Dependencies:
- Theoretical foundation supports all later moves
- Methodology enables systematic analysis
- Integration builds naturally

These refinements strengthen the core theoretical contribution while maintaining feasible scope and strong literature support. The focus remains on establishing and analyzing the transmission/content luck distinction in testimonial knowledge.
