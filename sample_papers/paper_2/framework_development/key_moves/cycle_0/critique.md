# Scratch Work

Key considerations across moves:
- Need clear theoretical grounding from Pritchard for safety/virtue analysis
- Must develop distinct examples showing luck type independence 
- Each move should advance main thesis about testimonial knowledge
- Cognitive mechanism analysis needs additional support
- Case methodology requires careful development

Dependencies:
1. Theoretical foundation → Case analysis → Framework integration
2. Luck type distinction → Interaction analysis → Synthesis
3. Safety conditions → Virtue analysis → Complete framework

# Move Analysis

## Move 1: Theoretical Foundations
Argument assessment:
- Strong grounding in Pritchard's framework
- Clear connection to testimonial knowledge
- Safety/virtue distinction well-motivated
- Could strengthen cognitive mechanism piece

Development feasibility: HIGH
- Clear development path from literature
- Reasonable scope
- Manageable technical detail

Literature support:
- Pritchard provides core framework
- Chalmers/Jackson methodology useful
- Could use more on testimonial specifics

Recommendations:
- Add explicit safety condition adaptation
- Strengthen cognitive mechanism discussion
- Clarify testimonial knowledge features

## Move 2: Case Methodology
Argument assessment:
- Clear approach to distinguishing luck types
- Good use of controlled variation
- Needs stronger theoretical grounding
- Example selection could be improved

Development feasibility: MEDIUM
- Requires careful case construction
- May need additional examples
- Methodology development feasible

Literature support:
- Can adapt Pritchard's examples
- Chalmers/Jackson approach helpful
- Need more testimonial cases

Recommendations:
- Strengthen theoretical motivation
- Develop more diverse examples
- Clarify evaluation criteria

## Move 3: Conceptual Independence
Argument assessment:
- Clear logical structure
- Good use of examples
- Could strengthen modal analysis
- Needs more on virtue conditions

Development feasibility: HIGH
- Clear development path
- Manageable scope
- Good example potential

Literature support:
- Pritchard's framework crucial
- Modal analysis tools available
- Need more on testimonial aspects

Recommendations:
- Strengthen modal analysis
- Add virtue condition discussion
- Develop more testimonial cases

## Move 4: Interaction Analysis
Argument assessment:
- Novel contribution
- Needs stronger cognitive basis
- Good connection to framework
- Could clarify mechanisms

Development feasibility: MEDIUM
- Requires careful development
- May need additional support
- Scope potentially challenging

Literature support:
- Limited direct literature
- Can build from Pritchard
- Need additional resources

Recommendations:
- Strengthen cognitive basis
- Clarify mechanism details
- Consider scope carefully

## Move 5: Framework Integration
Argument assessment:
- Good synthesis approach
- Clear theoretical contribution
- Could strengthen practical aspects
- Needs more on implications

Development feasibility: HIGH
- Clear integration path
- Manageable scope
- Good theoretical basis

Literature support:
- Builds well from Pritchard
- Can use methodology tools
- Need more on applications

Recommendations:
- Add practical applications
- Strengthen implications
- Consider assessment tools

# Cross-Cutting Considerations

Dependencies:
- Theoretical foundation crucial for all moves
- Case analysis supports later development
- Integration builds on earlier moves

Structure:
- Logical progression of moves
- Good theoretical to practical flow
- Some gaps in support/development

Literature:
- Good use of Pritchard
- Could use more testimonial focus
- Methodology support available

# Summary Assessment
MINOR REFINEMENT

The moves form a coherent framework with clear development paths. Main needs:
1. Strengthen cognitive mechanism analysis
2. Develop more testimonial-specific examples
3. Add practical applications/implications
4. Clarify assessment criteria

Next steps:
1. Enhance theoretical foundation
2. Develop additional cases
3. Strengthen interaction analysis
4. Add practical elements
5. Create assessment framework

The basic structure is sound but needs targeted improvements in specific areas while maintaining current strengths.
