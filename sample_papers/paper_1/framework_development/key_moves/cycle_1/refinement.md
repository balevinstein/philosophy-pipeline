# Scratch Work
- Core critique suggests sound foundation but needs better integration
- Main concerns are connections between theory/practice and literature use
- Must maintain scope feasibility while adding implementation detail
- Need to balance Quinean constraints with practical utility
- Literature support could be better distributed across moves

Key Dependencies:
- Criteria establishment feeds directly into application
- Historical context must motivate framework
- Implementation needs theoretical grounding
- Literature needs to support both theory and practice

# Refinement Decisions

## Will Implement

1. Add explicit bridging sections between moves
- Rationale: Strengthens theoretical-practical connection while maintaining scope
- Implementation: Brief transitional paragraphs showing how criteria inform application

2. Enhance Chalmers/Jackson integration in Move 1
- Rationale: Better grounds criteria in available literature
- Implementation: Show how application conditionals support specific metrics

3. Expand implementation steps in Moves 3/4
- Rationale: Needed for practical utility
- Implementation: Add concrete procedural guidance while maintaining scope

4. Strengthen criteria justification
- Rationale: Better theoretical foundation needed
- Implementation: Add explicit reasoning for each metric choice

## Won't Implement

1. Full metric detail trimming
- Rationale: Current detail level necessary for practical application
- Alternative: Tighten presentation without removing content

2. Extensive new implementation detail
- Rationale: Would exceed space constraints
- Alternative: Focus on key steps and principles

# Updated Move Development

## Move 1: Establish Explicit Evaluative Criteria
1. Ground criteria in Quinean insights:
- Show how meaning holism informs metric selection
- Demonstrate criteria validity without strict analyticity
- Connect to Chalmers/Jackson application conditionals

2. Success metrics with justification:
Linguistic Alignment:
- Corpus analysis (validates actual usage patterns)
- Expert surveys (captures disciplinary consensus)
- Deviation documentation (ensures transparency)

Theoretical Fertility:
- Problem resolution (demonstrates practical utility)
- Research program generation (shows theoretical value)
- Integration potential (supports holistic assessment)

[Bridge to Application]
Shows how criteria inform method selection and implementation

## Move 2: Historical Context
- Frame Quinean challenges through application lens
- Show how Chalmers/Jackson address key issues
- Demonstrate framework response pattern
[Bridge to Application]
Connect historical problems to practical solutions

## Moves 3 & 4: Application
- Structure using application conditionals
- Explicit connection to evaluation criteria
- Concrete implementation steps
- Theoretical grounding for each step

# Change Notes
- Theoretical Foundations: Strengthened through better literature integration
- Move Interactions: Enhanced through explicit bridges
- Literature Integration: More evenly distributed across moves
- Framework Alignment: Maintained while improving connections
- Development Feasibility: Preserved through focused additions
- Dependencies: Clearer progression through explicit bridges

The refinements maintain the core framework while strengthening connections and practical utility. Each move now more explicitly supports the thesis while maintaining feasible development scope.
