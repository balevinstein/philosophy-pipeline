# Scratch Work
Key considerations across moves:
- Moves 1 & 2 provide theoretical foundation
- Moves 3 & 4 handle practical application
- Strong dependencies between criteria establishment and application
- Need clear progression from theory to practice
- Literature support concentrated in early moves

# Move Analysis

## Move 1: Establish Explicit Evaluative Criteria
Argument Assessment:
- Strong framework using three clear criteria domains
- Good balance between rigor and practicality
- Clear connection to Quinean concerns
- Could strengthen argument for specific metrics chosen

Development Feasibility:
+ Concrete metrics make development straightforward
+ Scope appropriate for space constraints
- May need to trim some metric detail
+ Clear development path from theory to implementation

Literature Support:
+ Builds effectively on Quine's holism concerns
+ Can use Chalmers/Jackson's application conditionals
- Could strengthen connection to their non-definitional approach
+ Framework acknowledges key theoretical challenges

Integration:
+ Essential foundation for later moves
+ Clear connection to thesis
+ Supports both descriptive/revisionary distinction
- May need stronger bridge to practical application

Recommendations:
1. Strengthen justification for specific metrics chosen
2. Tighten connection to Chalmers/Jackson methodology
3. Add explicit bridge to application moves
4. Trim some metric detail to ensure feasible scope

## Move 2: Historical Context 
Argument Assessment:
+ Focused treatment maintains scope
+ Clear progression from challenges to solutions
- Could strengthen connection to framework response
+ Good balance of context and relevance

Development Feasibility:
+ 400-word limit keeps scope manageable
+ Clear development structure
- May need tighter integration with criteria
+ Straightforward implementation path

Literature Support:
+ Strong engagement with Quine
- Could better utilize Chalmers/Jackson
+ Clear connection to key debates
+ Appropriate scope of coverage

Integration:
+ Sets up need for framework
+ Connects well to criteria development
- Could strengthen bridge to application
+ Supports overall thesis

Recommendations:
1. Strengthen connection to framework response
2. Better integrate Chalmers/Jackson perspective
3. Tighten link between historical problems and solutions
4. Add explicit transition to application

## Moves 3 & 4: Application
Argument Assessment:
+ Good use of application conditionals
+ Clear practical focus
- Could strengthen connection to criteria
+ Concrete implementation steps

Development Feasibility:
+ Clear development structure
+ Realistic scope
- May need more detail on implementation
+ Good use of available space

Literature Support:
+ Effective use of Chalmers/Jackson methodology
- Could better connect to Quinean constraints
+ Framework accommodates key concerns

Integration:
+ Strong connection to earlier moves
+ Clear practical payoff
- Could strengthen theoretical grounding
+ Advances main thesis

Recommendations:
1. Strengthen connection to evaluative criteria
2. Add detail on implementation steps
3. Better connect to Quinean constraints
4. Enhance theoretical grounding

# Cross-Cutting Considerations
Dependencies:
- Application moves depend heavily on criteria establishment
- Historical context supports both theory and practice
- Need clear progression through moves

Literature Coverage:
+ Good use of available sources
- Could better integrate throughout
+ Addresses key theoretical challenges

Framework Support:
+ Moves work together to support thesis
+ Clear progression from theory to practice
+ Good balance of components

# Summary Assessment
MINOR REFINEMENT

The moves are fundamentally sound with good integration and support. Key improvements needed:
1. Strengthen connections between theoretical and practical moves
2. Better integrate literature throughout
3. Add some implementation detail
4. Tighten criteria-application link

The framework is viable and well-supported, needing targeted refinements rather than major revision.
