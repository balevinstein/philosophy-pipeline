Descriptive analysis aims to capture existing usage and intuitions, while revisionary analysis prioritizes theoretical utility and precision. Rather than treating these as competing approaches to a single task, we show how they serve distinct philosophical purposes and require different evaluative standards. Through examination of historical debates and contemporary case studies, we demonstrate how this framework illuminates persistent disagreements about conceptual analysis while providing practical guidance for methodology selection. The distinction helps resolve apparent tensions in the literature by showing how critiques of conceptual analysis often target one type while defenses support the other. We develop specific criteria for distinguishing these approaches and offer a practical framework for matching analysis type to philosophical goals. This taxonomy provides new insight into the nature and value of conceptual analysis while offering concrete methodological guidance for philosophical practice.",

      "# Scratch Work\n\nKey considerations:\n1. Need clear, operationalizable criteria that genuinely distinguish approaches\n2. Criteria must reflect real methodological differences while remaining practical\n3. Should leverage existing literature while advancing beyond it\n4. Examples should illuminate rather than overshadow the framework\n\nPotential approaches:\n1. Start with paradigm cases and extract criteria\n2. Begin with theoretical principles and derive criteria\n3. Hybrid approach using both exemplars and principles\n\nKey challenges:\n- Avoiding artificial precision\n- Maintaining practical applicability\n- Balancing comprehensiveness with clarity\n- Ensuring criteria are genuinely discriminating\n\n# Final Argument Development\n\n## Argument Sketch\n\nThe argument should develop in four main stages:\n\n1. Establish fundamental orientations\n- Descriptive analysis aims to capture existing conceptual practices\n- Revisionary analysis seeks to refine/improve conceptual frameworks\n- Both share commitment to systematic investigation\n\n2. Derive core evaluative dimensions\n- Linguistic alignment: fit with actual usage patterns\n- Theoretical fertility: potential for advancing inquiry\n- Methodological transparency: clarity of process and assumptions\n\n3. Specify success criteria for each dimension\n- Descriptive analysis prioritizes:\n  * High linguistic alignment\n  * Moderate theoretical fertility\n  * High methodological transparency\n- Revisionary analysis prioritizes:\n  * Moderate linguistic alignment\n  * High theoretical fertility\n  * High methodological transparency\n\n4. Establish evaluation procedures\n- Quantitative and qualitative metrics\n- Comparative assessment guidelines\n- Quality control mechanisms\n\n## Initial Examples\n\n1. Knowledge Attribution\n- Descriptive: Analysis of how \"knows\" is used in practice\n- Revisionary: Gettier-motivated refinements\n\n2. Personal Identity\n- Descriptive: Folk concepts of personal continuity\n- Revisionary: Four-dimensionalist accounts\n\n## Key Steps\n\n1. Ground distinction in methodological commitments\n2. Develop specific success metrics for each criterion\n3. Demonstrate practical application\n4. Address potential objections\n5. Connect to broader framework\n\n## Integration Notes\n\nThis argument:\n1. Supports main thesis by providing concrete evaluation tools\n2. Fits framework by operationalizing theoretical distinctions\n3. Builds toward case study application\n4. Maintains focus through consistent criteria application\n\nThe argument should be positioned within section 2.2, providing the foundational framework that subsequent sections will apply and develop. It should occupy approximately 800-1000 words to maintain proper balance within the paper's structure.\n\nKey connections to maintain:\n- Links to theoretical foundations (2.1)\n- Preparation for detailed analysis types (2.3, 2.4)\n- Setup for application principles (3.1)\n- Foundation for case study (4)\n\nThis will provide a robust yet flexible framework for distinguishing and evaluating different approaches to conceptual analysis while maintaining practical applicability.",
