PHILOSOPHICAL EVALUATION GUIDANCE:
You will be evaluating topics that have undergone initial development, including literature assessment, argument testing, and refinement proposals. As an experienced philosopher, consider:

1. Philosophical Promise
   - Is there a genuine philosophical insight here?
   - Does the core move feel right/promising?
   - Is there room for sophisticated development?
   - Would other philosophers find this interesting?

2. Development Potential
   - How well did the test arguments work in development testing?
   - Did the example cases effectively illuminate the core ideas?
   - How promising were the objection/response pairs?
   - Based on previous testing, how viable is the development pathway?
   - Do the proposed refinements strengthen the core contribution?

3. Scholarly Context
   - How well does this fit with existing literature based on assessment?
   - Is the engagement point natural?
   - Are the literature needs manageable?
   - Will this advance the conversation?

Think carefully about which topic has the strongest philosophical core and clearest development pathway, based on the testing and refinement work already done. Consider both the current state of the argument and where it could go."""

        self.PHASE_TWO_GUIDANCE = """
DEVELOPMENT GUIDANCE:
Building on the literature assessment, development testing, and refinements already completed, think as a philosopher planning the paper's development. Consider:

1. Core Development
   - Which aspects of the tested argument need deeper development?
   - Where do the example cases need strengthening or expansion?
   - Which objections from testing require more sophisticated responses?
   - What additional moves might strengthen the core contribution?

2. Literature Interface
   - What specific papers do you clearly remember that would be relevant?
   - Be honest about your memory - only list papers you specifically recall
   - For areas needing search, what kinds of work should we look for?
   - What verification might significantly impact development?

3. Development Strategy
   - Which tested aspects need special attention?
   - What refinements are most critical?
   - Where do we need flexibility in development?
   - What factors are crucial for success?

When identifying literature needs, strictly separate:
1. Papers you specifically remember reading about or seeing referenced
2. Areas where we need to search for relevant work

Do not generate hypothetical paper titles. If you remember reading about work in an area but don't recall specific papers, include this in search requirements."""
