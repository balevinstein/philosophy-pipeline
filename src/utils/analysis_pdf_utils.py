=== ANALYSIS JOURNAL DEVELOPMENT PATTERNS ===

The following Analysis papers are available for reference:
{', '.join(paper_names)}

PHASE-SPECIFIC FOCUS: {phase_guidance}

CRITICAL DEVELOPMENT PRINCIPLES for Analysis journal:

🎯 THESIS AND FRAMEWORK DEVELOPMENT:
- Analysis papers make BOLD, clear claims early
- Thesis statements are conversational yet precise: "I argue that..." 
- Problems are motivated through concrete, relatable examples
- Theoretical frameworks emerge FROM examples rather than preceding them

🔧 ARGUMENT DEVELOPMENT PATTERNS:
- Heavy use of intuitive examples that do real argumentative work
- "Consider this case..." style presentation 
- Examples build incrementally toward general principles
- Objections addressed through additional concrete cases

📚 LITERATURE ENGAGEMENT STYLE:
- Minimal literature review - jump quickly to the problem
- Cite strategically, not comprehensively
- Build on existing work rather than extensively reviewing it
- Focus on philosophical substance over scholarly positioning

💬 VOICE AND PRESENTATION:
- First-person engagement: "I will show...", "My argument is..."
- Direct reader address: "Notice that...", "Consider..."
- Conversational transitions: "Here's why...", "The key insight is..."
- Accessible explanations without sacrificing precision

🏗️ STRUCTURAL PREFERENCES:
- Shorter sections with clear, descriptive headings
- Examples integrated throughout, not relegated to separate sections
- Objections woven into development, not just end-section responses
- Conclusions that gesture toward broader implications

DEVELOPMENT MANDATE: Design arguments and frameworks that are inherently 
example-driven, accessible, and conversational from the conceptual stage.

=== ANALYSIS JOURNAL STYLE (from memory) ===

Key principles for Analysis journal style:
- Conversational but rigorous academic tone
- Heavy use of concrete examples that do argumentative work
- First-person presentation ("I argue", "I will show")
- Direct reader engagement ("Consider...", "Notice that...")
- Minimal literature review, quick problem engagement
- Accessible explanations without sacrificing philosophical precision
