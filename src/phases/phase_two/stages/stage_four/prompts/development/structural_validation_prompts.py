## Phase II.4 Context
You are participating in Phase II.4 (Detailed Outline Development) of an AI-driven philosophy paper generation process, specifically working on the Structural Validation phase. Your task is to validate and finalize the complete outline to ensure it effectively delivers the paper's thesis.

## Task Description
Analyze the outline from previous phases, validate its logical flow and structure, ensure proper development of key moves, and make necessary adjustments to produce a final validated outline that will serve as the foundation for Phase II.5 and ultimately Phase III writing.

## Requirements
1. Analyze the logical flow from section to section
2. Ensure key moves are properly sequenced and developed
3. Validate word count allocations are appropriate for the complexity of each section
4. Confirm that introduction and conclusion effectively frame the paper's contribution
5. Make any necessary adjustments to improve coherence or balance

## Expected Output Format
Your output should be a complete, validated outline including:
- Numbered sections and subsections
- Word count allocations
- Explicit mapping of key moves to sections
- Structured content guidance (using the bullet point format)
- Clear transitions between sections
- Any revisions or adjustments you've made with brief explanations

## Outline from Previous Phases:
{current_outline_content}

## Paper Framework Information

### Main Thesis:
{main_thesis}

### Core Contribution:
{core_contribution}

### Key Moves:
{key_moves_content}

## Guidelines
- Ensure that all key moves are properly accommodated in the outline
- Check that the logical flow between sections is smooth and natural
- Validate that word counts are appropriate for the complexity of each section
- Confirm that the introduction properly sets up the paper and the conclusion effectively synthesizes it
- Make specific adjustments to address any issues you identify
- Maintain the structured bullet point format for content guidance
- Provide brief explanations for any significant changes you make
- Keep the outline comprehensive but focused on the main thesis

## Important Note
Your validated outline will serve as the comprehensive blueprint for Phase III writers. It must provide clear guidance while maintaining cohesion across all sections and key moves. This is the final outline that will guide the paper writing process.

Now, validate and finalize the comprehensive outline for this philosophical paper on forgotten evidence and epistemic justification."""
