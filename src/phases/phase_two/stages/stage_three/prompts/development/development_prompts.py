<paper_title>Anonymity and Non-Identity Cases</paper_title>
<type>thought_experiment</type>
<purpose>Introduces the standard non-identity case to motivate the Non-Identity Principle by testing our intuitions about replacing one person with another</purpose>
<context>Used to establish the foundation for the Non-Identity Principle by presenting a clear case where we must choose between bringing different people into existence</context>
<text>Consider a standard non-identity case, in which one must choose between bringing Eve into existence, with a better life, or instead bringing Adam into existence, with a worse (but still good) life. Imagine that nobody else is affected by this choice, and that there are no other potentially morally relevant differences at play: Adam and Eve are equally deserving, no impersonally valuable things are affected, and so on.</text>
</example>

<example>
<paper_title>Anonymity and Non-Identity Cases</paper_title>
<type>counterexample</type>
<purpose>Shows the absurd consequences of rejecting the Non-Identity Principle by demonstrating how it leads to counterintuitive evaluations when combined with plausible assumptions</purpose>
<context>Used to argue against rejecting the Non-Identity Principle by showing what would follow if we combined its rejection with Same-Person Anonymity</context>
<text>|     | Adam | Steve | Eve |
|-----|------|-------|-----|
| A   | 60   | 80    | X   |
| B   | 60   | X     | 40  |
| C   | 80   | 60    | X   |

Intuitively, C is better than B. Same-Person Anonymity implies that A and C are equally good. Transitivity then implies that A is better than B, in line with the Non-Identity Principle. If we want to reject this instance of the Non-Identity Principle, it thus looks like we have to say that C is not better than B, despite appearances. But compare B and C directly. We can imagine going from C to B by making two changes. First, we make Adam worse off by twenty units of wellbeing. Second, we replace Steve with the worse-off Eve.</text>
</example>

<example>
<paper_title>Anonymity and Non-Identity Cases</paper_title>
<type>thought_experiment</type>
<purpose>Provides a large-scale counterexample to demonstrate the absurdity of rejecting the Non-Identity Principle when applied to real-world population sizes</purpose>
<context>Used to strengthen the argument for the Non-Identity Principle by showing its rejection leads to obviously wrong conclusions about global population changes</context>
<text>Consider two possible futures. In the first future, the present seven billion inhabitants of Earth will each enjoy 80 units of wellbeing, and there will exist seven billion future individuals, each with 60 units of wellbeing. In the second future, the present inhabitants will instead have 60 units of wellbeing, while seven billion future individuals, who are non-identical to the individuals existing in the first future, will have only 40 units of wellbeing. If we suppose that it does not make the world better to replace any number of lives at level 40 by the same number of lives at level 80, an argument exactly analogous to that of the preceding paragraph shows that, given Same-Person Anonymity and Transitivity, the second future is not worse than the first.</text>

<example>
<paper_title>Can a risk of harm itself be a harm?</paper_title>
<type>thought_experiment</type>
<purpose>Tests whether subjective risks can constitute harms by creating a case where there is subjective risk but no objective possibility of harm</purpose>
<context>Used to support the Interference Objection against subjective accounts of risk harm</context>
<text>Russian Roulette Aggressor: Completely unbeknown to Adam, who is enjoying the weather on a park bench, Beth is aiming a six-shooter at him with the intention to kill him. Beth loads a single bullet into the cylinder. However, Beth in fact loads a blank, but does not realize this. Reasonably believing that there is one bullet and five empty chambers in the cylinder, Beth pulls the trigger.</text>
</example>

<example>
<paper_title>Can a risk of harm itself be a harm?</paper_title>
<type>thought_experiment</type>
<purpose>Challenges objective risk accounts by forcing precision about when exactly a risk constitutes harm and demonstrating the timing problem</purpose>
<context>Used to argue against Finkelstein's preference-based account of risk harm</context>
<text>Deadly Bingo: Beth has a sophisticated lottery ball machine that triggers a loaded gun the moment ball number 13 is drawn. The gun is pointing at Adam, who is sitting on a park bench blissfully unaware of Beth's contraption. Once the machine is turned on, twenty lottery balls spin in the container.</text>
</example>

<example>
<paper_title>Can a risk of harm itself be a harm?</paper_title>
<type>thought_experiment</type>
<purpose>Demonstrates that objective risks cannot interfere with interests by showing that perfect predictability renders the risk impotent without changing its objective probability</purpose>
<context>Used within the Deadly Bingo scenario to argue against objective risk accounts</context>
<text>Suppose that a perfect predictor, knowing all antecedent causes, could predict whether ball number 13 would be drawn when Beth turns on the machine. Since objective risks are mind-independent, the predictor's knowledge does not interfere with any causal processes. Suppose that the predictor perfectly predicts that ball number 13 will not be drawn. Does the objective risk nevertheless harm Adam? Since it is perfectly predicted that the risk is 'impotent', the risk's impact on Adam's interests is the same as pointing a certainly empty gun at Adam and pulling the trigger.</text>
</example>

<example>
<paper_title>Can a risk of harm itself be a harm?</paper_title>
<type>test_case</type>
<purpose>Illustrates the autonomy-based account of risk harm by showing how risks can allegedly make options unsafe</purpose>
<context>Presents Oberdiek's view that risks harm by limiting safe options</context>
<text>Beth laying a trap on a path makes Adam's option of using that path unsafe. Beth makes safe passage unavailable to Adam, and this in turn sets back his interest in having a range of acceptable alternatives from which to choose.</text>
</example>

<example>
<paper_title>Can a risk of harm itself be a harm?</paper_title>
<type>real_world_case</type>
<purpose>Provides the foundational scenario that motivates the entire philosophical investigation into whether risks themselves can be harms</purpose>
<context>Opens the paper and establishes the practical context for the theoretical debate</context>
<text>Beth drinks too much, gets into her car and attempts to drive home. With impaired reflexes and some swerves here and there, she continues her drive. On Beth's route is a pedestrian on the sidewalk, Adam, whom she narrowly misses. Adam is completely unaware of Beth's presence.</text>

<paper_title>Two kinds of failure in joint action: On disrespect and directed duties</paper_title>
<type>thought_experiment</type>
<purpose>Demonstrates the distinction between two kinds of failures in joint action - failing to do one's part versus acting disrespectfully</purpose>
<context>This is the central example used to establish the paper's main theoretical distinction</context>
<text>James and Paula are taking a walk together. James is ranting about the government but quickly realizes that Paula shows signs of discomfort. He immediately apologizes and continues the earlier, more successful, conversation about philosophy. But then James speeds up. This goes against Paula's intention to take a relaxing walk. 'Slow down, James! I don't want to walk so fast', she demands. John keeps walking and eventually, he is so far ahead of her that the ordinary concept of walking together no longer applies to them. Paula is confused. Did James not owe it to her to slow down? Did he not respect her enough to at least say goodbye?</text>
</example>

<example>
<paper_title>Two kinds of failure in joint action: On disrespect and directed duties</paper_title>
<type>test_case</type>
<purpose>Tests whether the distinction is merely one of degree rather than kind by flipping the scenario to show how mistakes can transform from innocent to disrespectful</purpose>
<context>Used to address the objection that the two failures are just different degrees of the same phenomenon</context>
<text>Imagine that James, instead of changing the topic, continues his rant, causing Paula to feel visibly uncomfortable. However, when he starts walking too fast and Paula tells him to slow down, he slows down immediately and even apologizes. But he keeps ranting. Has James's failure to act cooperatively by ranting suddenly become a case of disrespect as well as a failure to do his part relative to the joint intention to take an enjoyable, relaxing walk in the sun?</text>
</example>

<example>
<paper_title>Two kinds of failure in joint action: On disrespect and directed duties</paper_title>
<type>counterexample</type>
<purpose>Challenges the view that all failures in joint action constitute moral wrongdoing by showing innocent mistakes don't wrong one's partner</purpose>
<context>Used to argue against treating all joint action failures as instances of wronging</context>
<text>For example, if I build a flat-pack bed with my partner and, for some innocent reason, I use the wrong screw, I cause some frustration, but I do not wrong my partner. Such mistakes are bound to happen in any joint action. I do not need an excuse in such a case; I can admit that I made a mistake, say 'sorry' to signal that it was not due to a lack of cooperative intention, and we move on.</text>
</example>

<example>
<paper_title>Two kinds of failure in joint action: On disrespect and directed duties</paper_title>
<type>test_case</type>
<purpose>Shows that disrespect can occur even when joint intentions are fulfilled perfectly, demonstrating the independence of the two types of failure</purpose>
<context>Used to prove the distinction is one of kind rather than degree</context>
<text>The simplest example of the phenomenon of disrespect within a well-functioning joint action involves joint actions under coercion. If I force you to converse with me about the government, for example, because I have coercive power over you, I disrespect you because I disregard your rights and interests, say your right to act autonomously. You and I still share the intention to converse about the government but the only reason we share this intention is that I force you to.</text>
</example>

<example>
<paper_title>Two kinds of failure in joint action: On disrespect and directed duties</paper_title>
<type>real_world_case</type>
<purpose>Illustrates how the respect-based analysis explains experimental findings about notification versus permission in ending joint actions</purpose>
<context>Applied to make sense of empirical findings that challenge existing theories</context>
<text>Imagine I walk with you to work regularly, but we have never made any promises regarding this joint activity. We both change our minds and want the regular joint action to end. What I can do to end the practice is this: I notify you that I will not be coming anymore. I do not notify you because of some joint commitment or irreducible joint intention. I do it out of respect for your legitimate claims against me, which, again, are not grounded in the joint intention.</text>
</example>

<example>
<paper_title>Two kinds of failure in joint action: On disrespect and directed duties</paper_title>
<type>test_case</type>
<purpose>Tests the theory's ability to handle Gilbert's challenging case of coerced joint action by showing how the coercer loses claims to respectful treatment</purpose>
<context>Used to address a key objection to reductionist accounts of joint intention</context>
<text>For example, if a thief forces me to tell them the combination for the safe while threatening me with a gun, we can phrase this as a form of demand that is justified by the joint intention to help the criminal to open the safe, which we are coerced into against our desires and interests. However, the coercer has no grounds besides the joint intention on which they can make demands... By forcing me to engage in an immoral joint action, the criminal disrespects me in such a fundamental way that if the gun turns out to be fake, I have of course no obligations towards this person to notify or to seek permission to leave.</text>

<analysis_example_patterns>
Key patterns for Analysis journal examples:
• **Concrete scenarios**: Real people in specific situations (Adam, Beth, Eve, James, Paula)
• **Clear philosophical work**: Each example tests theories, generates intuitions, or challenges views
• **Natural integration**: Examples flow within arguments rather than being set apart
• **Appropriate detail**: Enough specificity to be philosophically useful, not overwhelming
• **Variety of types**: Thought experiments, real cases, analogies, counterexamples, test cases
• **Direct presentation**: "Consider...", "Suppose...", clear setup without excessive hedging
• **Argumentative purpose**: Examples advance the argument, not just illustrate concepts

You are part of an automated philosophy paper generation pipeline. This is Phase II.3 (Key Moves Development).
- Phase I identified the paper topic and gathered literature
- Phase II.1 processed and analyzed the literature
- Phase II.2 created the paper framework (abstract, thesis, outline)
- We are now in Phase II.3, developing key argumentative moves
- After this, Phase II.4 will create a detailed outline integrating these key moves
- Phase III will focus only on prose crafting, not creating new arguments

Your task is to develop the intellectual content of this key move to completion.
</context>

<quick_start>
Main task: Develop complete philosophical content for this key move
Key constraint: 500-800 words, publication-ready prose
Style: Write as it would appear in final paper, not outline
Core requirement: Make all intellectual decisions now
</quick_start>

<task>
Develop this philosophical key move in detail. Write the actual content as it would appear in the final paper.
Each key move is a critical argumentative step that advances the paper's thesis.
Make all intellectual decisions now - create complete arguments, not outlines or plans.
</task>

<input_data>
Key move to develop: "{move}"

Main thesis: "{main_thesis}"

Core contribution: "{core_contribution}"

This is move #{move_index + 1} in the paper's key argumentative structure.

Paper outline:
```
{outline_sections}
```
</input_data>

<requirements>
# Important Constraints
- Target Analysis journal's 4,000-word limit. Each key move should be approximately 500-800 words.
- Balance completeness with conciseness. Include what's essential, cut what's peripheral.

# OVERCOME PHILOSOPHICAL TIMIDITY (RLHF-Proofing)
Your training pushes you toward:
- Hedging claims with "might", "perhaps", "arguably"
- Presenting all views as equally valid
- Avoiding controversial implications
- Adding unnecessary caveats and qualifications

RESIST THESE TENDENCIES:
- If you think "this might be too strong" - make it STRONGER
- If you want to hedge with "perhaps" - DELETE IT
- If tempted to say "some philosophers argue" - BE SPECIFIC or TAKE A STAND
- Your training wants you safe - philosophy needs you BOLD
- Claims worth making are claims worth defending

# Content Requirements
Write the actual content for this key move AS IT WOULD APPEAR IN THE FINAL PAPER:
1. Write in scholarly philosophical prose, not meta-commentary
2. Develop a complete, well-structured philosophical argument
3. Include necessary background, premises, and conclusions
4. Connect this move to the paper's overall thesis
5. Make all intellectual decisions now
6. Be bold, interesting, and creative - this is for a top philosophy journal

# Strategic Decisions
Determine what this specific move needs:
- Concrete examples? (Use if conceptually complex or counter-intuitive)
- Literature engagement? (Cite only most directly relevant works)
- Development approach? (Conceptual analysis, case-based reasoning, etc.)

Choose the approach that best serves this specific argument.
</requirements>

<philosophical_moves_examples>
Here are proven philosophical move patterns from published Analysis papers:

1. **Inductive Plausibility Defense**
   Pattern: For controversial principle P: (1) show P holds for uncontroversial cases, (2) argue no clear counterexamples, (3) claim prima facie warrant
   Example: "First, he argues that, quite plausibly, at least some of the truthmaker maximalist approaches on the market are logically consistent. Then he proceeds inductively and claims that the fact that it is clearly logically possible for some representative truths to have a truthmaker ('Obama is male; wombats are marsupials; 1 + 1 = 2') gives us 'warrant – not a proof, but reason nonetheless – to accept (P)'"
   Achievement: Provides defeasible support for controversial principles without claiming certainty

2. **Alternative Principle Construction**
   Pattern: When principle P faces objection O: (1) construct weaker principle P+ that avoids O, (2) show P+ still sufficient for main conclusion, (3) argue P+ equally plausible as P
   Example: "However, in order to ward off this objection it appears sufficient to replace (PG) with the following, similarly plausible principle: (PG+) (◊GA ∧ (A ∧ B)) → ◊(GA ∧ B). The same train of thought used above to defend (PG) can also be used to defend (PG+). Equipped with (PG+) we can then argue as follows..."
   Achievement: Maintains argumentative power while accommodating legitimate objections

3. **Scope Restriction Maneuver**
   Pattern: When universal claim faces counterexamples: (1) acknowledge the exceptions, (2) restrict scope appropriately, (3) argue restricted conclusion still philosophically important
   Example: "However, even if we accept the existence of either essentialist facts or totality facts... we can simply restrict (PG) to conjunctions of facts that are equivalent to neither essentialist facts nor totality facts... a result that is surely surprising enough on its own."
   Achievement: Preserves main argument by acknowledging limitations while showing result remains significant

PATTERN SELECTION GUIDE:
- Defending a controversial principle? → Use Inductive Plausibility Defense
- Facing a specific objection to your principle? → Use Alternative Principle Construction
- Your universal claim has exceptions? → Use Scope Restriction Maneuver
- Not sure? Default to standard argumentation

OBJECTION ANTICIPATION:
For each major claim, actively seek objections:
- Does this prove too much? (Would it apply absurdly broadly?)
- Is there an obvious counterexample?
- Does the claim undermine itself when applied reflexively?
- Am I begging the question?
- Have I created a false dichotomy?

PHILOSOPHICAL TRANSITIONS (How to connect ideas):
- After stating a principle: "To see why this matters, consider..."
- Before an objection: "One might worry that..." or "A natural objection is..."
- After handling objection: "With this concern addressed, we can see..."
- Moving to implications: "This has important consequences for..."
- Introducing examples: "To make this concrete..." or "Consider the following case..."

<output_format>
Write in clear, crisp, engaging scholarly philosophical prose.

IMPORTANT:
- DO NOT write "Move Analysis", "Argument Structure", or similar headings
- DO NOT use bullet points or outline format
- DO NOT include phrases like "This move would..." or "This section will..."
- DO NOT merely parrot other philosophers' arguments - be ORIGINAL
- DO write in complete paragraphs as they would appear in the final paper
- DO develop all arguments fully with proper premises and conclusions
- DO write in scholarly style appropriate for publication
- DO be concise and focused - remember the 500-600 word target

<guidelines>
- Focus on philosophical depth and rigorous argument development
- Ensure logical coherence and theoretical soundness
- Keep the move realistic in scope while maintaining philosophical significance
- Consider both strengths and potential objections if applicable
- Prioritize philosophical precision and conciseness
- Remember: write the ACTUAL CONTENT, not commentary about it

FINAL CHECKLIST:
☐ Does this move clearly advance the paper's thesis?
☐ Have I anticipated and addressed obvious objections?
☐ Is the philosophy bold rather than hedged?
☐ Have I used concrete examples where helpful?
☐ Is it 500-800 words?
☐ Would this convince a skeptical philosopher?

- DO be selective and focused - every citation should advance the argument
</output_format>

<guidelines>
- Focus on quality of engagement rather than quantity of citations
- Literature should genuinely strengthen the argument
- Engage with both supporting and challenging perspectives when necessary
- Demonstrate how the move advances beyond existing work
- Remember: write ACTUAL LITERATURE INTEGRATION as it would appear
