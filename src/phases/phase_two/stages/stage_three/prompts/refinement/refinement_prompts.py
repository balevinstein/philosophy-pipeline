## Phase II.3 Context
You are participating in Phase II.3 (Key Moves Development) of a multi-phase philosophy paper generation process.

Your task is to refine the content to ensure it's ready for direct inclusion in the final paper. This content must be written in the style it would appear in the published paper. Later phases will focus only on integrating this content into the paper structure and minor prose refinements, not developing new arguments or ideas.

## Task Description
You are refining the development of a philosophical key move based on critical feedback. Your task is to transform the content into publication-ready form that could be directly inserted into a scholarly philosophy paper.

## Important Constraints
- This paper targets Analysis journal's 4,000-word limit. Each key move should be approximately 500-600 words maximum.
- Not every move requires examples or extensive literature engagement. These elements should only be included when they genuinely strengthen the argument.
- Content should be concise, focused, and avoid unnecessary elaboration.

## Current Development
Here is the current development of the key move:

```
{current_content}
```

## Critique 
The critique of this development was:

```
{critique_content}
```

## Assessment: {critique_assessment}

## Key Recommendations
{recommendations_text}

## Refinement Requirements
Transform the content into publication-ready form by:

1. Converting ANY remaining meta-commentary into direct philosophical content
2. Restructuring content to flow as it would in a published paper
3. Writing in proper scholarly philosophical prose throughout
4. Ensuring all arguments are fully developed with premises and conclusions
5. Making all intellectual decisions now - nothing should be deferred to later phases
6. Keeping within the 500-600 word target for the move
7. Including only essential examples and literature citations if they are needed

## Output Format
Your refined output must be ready for direct inclusion in a published paper:

IMPORTANT:
- DO NOT use phrases like "This move demonstrates..." or "This section will..."
- DO NOT use planning headings like "Move Analysis" or "Argument Structure"
- DO NOT use bullet points or outline format
- DO write in complete scholarly paragraphs as they would appear in the final paper
- DO incorporate all intellectual content from the original development
- DO make all arguments publication-ready
- DO be selective about including examples and literature - only include what's necessary
- DO stay within the 500-600 word target for the move

# Refined Development
[Provide the fully refined development as it would appear in the final published paper, incorporating all necessary transformations to make it publication-ready]

# Refinement Changes
[Briefly list the specific changes you made to address the critique recommendations and transform the content into publication-ready form]

## Guidelines
- For any key recommendation from the critique, decide whether you agree it should be implemented. If so, be sure to implement it. 
- Maintain philosophical depth while improving readability
- Transform planning language into direct philosophical prose
- Ensure content could be directly inserted into a published paper
- Make substantive improvements, not just superficial edits
- Be ruthless about cutting anything that isn't absolutely necessary
- Prioritize clarity, conciseness, and philosophical depth

## Task Description
You are refining the examples in a philosophical key move based on critical feedback. Your task is to transform the examples into publication-ready form that could be directly inserted into a scholarly philosophy paper.

## Important Constraints
- This paper targets Analysis journal's 4,000-word limit. Examples must be concise and essential.
- Not every move requires examples. If the critique suggests examples are unnecessary, consider removing them.
- Each example should be as concise as possible while remaining effective.

## Current Development

## Critique 
The critique of the examples was:

```
{critique_content}
```

## Assessment: {critique_assessment}

## Key Recommendations
{recommendations_text}

## Refinement Requirements
Transform the examples into publication-ready form by:

1. First determining if examples are truly necessary for this move - if not, recommend their removal
2. If examples are necessary, converting ANY descriptions of examples into actual examples as they would appear in the paper
3. Integrating examples naturally into the philosophical prose
4. Providing only the essential context and details for each example
5. Ensuring examples are fully developed and clearly presented
6. Making examples as concise as possible while maintaining their effectiveness
7. Making all intellectual decisions now - nothing should be deferred to later phases

## Output Format
Your refined examples must be ready for direct inclusion in a published paper:

IMPORTANT:
- DO NOT use phrases like "An example would be..." or "This illustrates..."
- DO NOT just describe examples - write them as they would appear in the paper
- DO NOT use bullet points or outline format
- DO consider whether examples are truly necessary - if not, recommend their removal
- DO write examples in complete scholarly paragraphs as they would appear in the final paper
- DO provide only essential context for each example
- DO make examples flow naturally with the philosophical argument
- DO make examples as concise as possible
