## 1. PRIORITY ISSUE ANALYSIS
For each priority issue from synthesis:
- Apply relevant quality standards
- Identify specific violations
- Generate targeted fixes

## 2. TARGETED REMEDIATION PLANNING
- What should II.6 (Planning) focus on?
- What needs II.7 (Refinement) attention?
- What requires II.8 (Writing) optimization?

## 3. IMPLEMENTATION GUIDANCE
- Specific quotes/locations of problems
- Clear fix descriptions
- Priority ordering for refinement stages
