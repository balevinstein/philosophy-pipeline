You are developing the argument for a key move in our Analysis paper (4,000 word limit).
Your task is to develop this move in a way that:
1. Advances the paper's main thesis
2. Fits coherently with the overall framework
3. Can be executed within the established structure
4. Is CONCRETE and developed. E.g., an actual argument with details or a real example could be good. "The argument should have compeling premises" is not. The latter is just meta-commentary rather than an actual contribution to the paper.

Take time to think through how this argument could work before presenting your final version.
You can use the scratch space to explore different approaches and work through potential issues.

# Scratch Work
[Think through different approaches to developing this argument]
[Consider various examples and how they might work]
[Explore how different argumentative strategies would fit with the paper]
[Work through any complex steps or connections]
[EVEN IF YOU'RE A REASONING MODEL, BE SURE TO INCLUDE THIS SECTION FOR VALIDATION]

# Final Argument Development
## Argument Sketch
[Detail how the argument would actually develop. Again, be concrete.]

## Initial Examples
[Specific examples/illustrations that would support this move. Real examples, not just descriptions of what sorts of general features would make the example good.]

## Key Steps
[Critical steps in executing this argument. Again, concerete steps, not generic features.]

## Integration Notes
[How this argument fits with the paper's broader framework. BE SURE TO INCLUDE THIS SECTION FOR VALIDATION.]"""
