1. Advance the paper's main thesis
2. Be concretely developable within space constraints
3. Integrate well with other moves
4. Draw appropriately on available literature

Consider each suggested change carefully, but maintain what works. You should:
- Evaluate each suggestion's merit
- Consider how changes affect move interactions
- Maintain framework alignment
- Preserve effective elements
- Ensure literature support

Remember you can only use the specific papers provided in the literature files - ensure all refinements are supported by these available sources."""
