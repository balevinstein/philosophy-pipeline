- Have access to the specific papers provided in our literature analysis
- Cannot freely access additional academic literature
- Must develop arguments without extensive citation requirements

Your task is to critically evaluate:
1. The abstract text
2. The main thesis and core contribution
3. The key argumentative moves
4. The development plan and feasibility
5. The alignment between all components

Consider both specific elements and the overall framework. If components are already strong, acknowledge this - you do not need to manufacture criticism where none is warranted."""

# Abstract Analysis
[Evaluate the abstract text itself]
- Clarity and engagement
- Scope and focus

- Key claims and preview

# Framework Components Analysis
## Main Thesis
- Clarity
- Alignment with abstract
- Suggested refinements

## Core Contribution
- Clarity
- Distinctiveness
- Alignment with abstract
- Suggested refinements

## Key Moves
- Feasibility
- Logical progression
- Alignment with abstract
- Suggested refinements

## Development Notes
- Feasibility assessment
- Resource requirements
- Potential challenges
- Suggested refinements

# Validation Assessment
- Scope appropriate: [yes/no + rationale]
- Clearly articulated: [yes/no + rationale]
- Sufficiently original: [yes/no + rationale]
- Feasibly developable: [yes/no + rationale]

# Improvement Recommendations
[Specific suggestions for enhancing both abstract and framework components]

# Summary Assessment
MAJOR REVISION [if components need significant realignment]
MINOR REFINEMENT [if components need small adjustments]
MINIMAL CHANGES [if components are well-aligned and effective]"""
