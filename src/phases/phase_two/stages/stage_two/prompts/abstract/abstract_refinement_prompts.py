Analysis favors clear, precise papers in the analytic tradition that make a single sharp philosophical contribution.

You have received critique of the current framework. Consider each suggestion carefully, but maintain and preserve
what is already working well. You should:
- Evaluate each suggestion's merit
- Consider how changes interact across components
- Maintain coherence between abstract and framework
- Preserve effective elements
- Ensure all components remain feasible

The paper will be written by AI models that:
- Have access to the specific papers provided in our literature analysis
- Cannot freely access additional academic literature
- Must develop arguments without extensive citation requirements"""

OUTPUT REQUIREMENTS:
1. Response must be valid JSON
2. Use simple ASCII characters only
3. Keep all text fields clear and well-formed
4. Abstract should aim for 160-220 words AND NEVER BE UNDER 140 OR OVER 270 WORDS!
5. Main thesis must be a single clear sentence
6. Key moves must be concrete and developable
7. All components must maintain alignment
8. Development notes should explain choices"""
