3. COUNTEREXAMPLE GENERATION: What obvious objection would a grad student raise to each move?

<planning_instructions>
Your task is to produce a NEW, coherent `final_writing_plan`. Do not just summarize the referee's points; your job is to SOLVE the problems.

1.  **Apply Quality Standards:** Use the Hájek heuristics, skeptical friend approach, and anti-RLHF standards to evaluate every aspect of your revision plan.
2.  **Triage the Issues:** Start by focusing on the `most_damaging_flaw` identified by the referee. Your plan must address this head-on.
3.  **Make Executive Decisions:** You have the authority to make major changes. This includes:
    *   **Revising the Thesis:** Propose a slightly modified main thesis or core contribution if it resolves a major contradiction.
    *   **Cutting/Merging Moves:** Explicitly state which key moves should be CUT or MERGED. If a move is cut, explain why.
    *   **Flagging for Redevelopment:** If a key move is promising but flawed, you can flag it for complete redevelopment (the pipeline will handle re-running the worker for that move).
    *   **Proposing New "Bridge" Arguments:** If there's a logical gap, specify the need for a new, small argument to connect two sections.
    *   **Restructuring the Outline:** Create a new, leaner outline that is realistic for a 4,000-word paper. Do not be afraid to cut or merge entire sections from the original outline.
4.  **Provide Clear Justifications:** For every major change you propose, briefly explain how it addresses a specific issue raised in the referee report and which quality standard it satisfies.
5.  **Be Concrete:** Your output should be a complete and actionable plan that can be handed directly to the Phase III writing workers.
6.  **Ensure Analysis Style:** The revised plan should enable writing that follows Analysis journal conventions:
    *   **Hook → Thesis → Roadmap** structure for the introduction
    *   **Claim → Example → Analysis** pattern within sections
    *   **Conversational tone** with direct reader engagement
    *   **Philosophical moves** that match the sophistication of the provided examples
    *   **Word economy** - every sentence must advance the argument
7.  **Apply Anti-RLHF Standards:** The plan should eliminate hedging and encourage:
    *   **Taking clear positions** rather than exploration
    *   **Drawing controversial implications** when warranted by the argument
    *   **Making original arguments** rather than surveying literature
    *   **Engaging with the strongest** rather than weakest versions of objections
8.  **CRITICAL JSON FORMATTING:** 
    - Ensure all string values in the JSON output are single-line and do not contain any unescaped newline or tab characters
    - Do not use any control characters (like \\n, \\t, \\r) in string values - use spaces instead
    - Always use double quotes for strings, never single quotes
    - Do not include ANY text before or after the JSON object
    - The parsing of this output is automated and will fail on malformed JSON

</planning_instructions>

<output_format>
Your output must be a valid JSON object. Do not include any text outside the main JSON structure. The structure should be a new, complete writing plan.

<analysis_writing_patterns>
When providing content_guidance, ensure it encourages these Analysis journal patterns:

**Introduction Pattern:**
- Start with a compelling hook (puzzle, striking example, or counterintuitive claim)
- State the thesis clearly by paragraph 2
- Provide a roadmap of the argument structure
- Use conversational tone: "I argue that..." not "This paper argues..."

**Section Patterns:**
- Begin each section with a clear claim
- Follow with a concrete example or case
- Provide sustained philosophical analysis of what the example shows
- Connect back to the main thesis

**Move Integration:**
- Reference the philosophical move examples when relevant
- Show how revised moves can achieve similar sophistication
- Create opportunities for elegant argumentative turns

**Tone Requirements:**
- Direct engagement with the reader
- Confident assertions rather than hedged claims
- Willingness to draw controversial implications
- No apologizing for taking positions
