### Key Concepts and Distinctions
[Identify crucial concepts we'll use or challenge. Show how different papers define/use these concepts.]

### Methodological Considerations
[Discuss philosophical methods seen in the literature and our approach.]

### Development Strategy
[Provide specific guidance for developing our paper, including:
- Which arguments to foreground
- Which objections to anticipate
- How to structure our engagement
- Where to be careful about scope]

### Gaps and Opportunities
[Identify what the literature misses or underdevelops that we can address.]

### Citation Strategy
