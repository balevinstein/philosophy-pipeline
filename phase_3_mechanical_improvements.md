# Phase III Mechanical Improvements - COMPLETE ✅

## Summary

All mechanical improvements for Phase III have been completed!

### Phase III.1 (Section Writing) ✅
- Writes paper sections based on detailed outlines
- Multiple writers work in parallel
- **Status**: COMPLETE
- Files updated:
  - SectionWritingPrompts ✅

### Phase III.2 (Global Integration) ✅
- Reviews complete draft for global coherence
- Integrates improvements for final paper
- **Status**: COMPLETE
- Files updated:
  - PaperReaderPrompts ✅ (extracted from worker)
  - PaperIntegrationPrompts ✅ (extracted from worker)
  - PaperReaderWorker ✅ (updated to use prompts class)
  - PaperIntegrationWorker ✅ (updated to use prompts class)

## Progress Summary

### Completed Mechanical Improvements:
- Phase III.1: 1 prompt class ✅
- Phase III.2: 2 prompt classes + 2 worker updates ✅
- **Total: 3 prompt classes enhanced**

### What Was Done:
1. **Added system_prompt attribute** to all classes
   - Section Writing: "You are an expert philosophy writer..."
   - Paper Reader: "You are a rigorous philosophy journal reviewer..."
   - Paper Integration: "You are an expert philosophy editor..."

2. **Added XML structure tags**
   - `<context>` - Pipeline awareness
   - `<task>` - Clear task description
   - `<requirements>` - Specific requirements
   - `<output_format>` - Expected output structure
   - Additional tags for specific contexts

3. **Extracted embedded prompts** from workers into separate classes

4. **Added pipeline context** to all prompts

5. **Added get_system_prompt() method** to all classes

## Next Steps

All mechanical improvements for Phase III are complete! The pipeline now has:
- Consistent XML structure across all phases
- System prompts defining clear roles
- Pipeline awareness in all prompts
- Clean separation of prompts from workers

Ready for:
1. Quick test of Phase III with improvements
2. Substantive improvements to Phase II (skeptical friend approach)
3. Substantive improvements to Phase III
4. Full pipeline testing
