# Phase II Remaining Mechanical Improvements - COMPLETE ✅

## Summary

All mechanical improvements for Phase II have been completed!

### Phase II.3 (Key Moves Development) ✅
- Develops each key move through three phases
- Initial → Examples → Literature integration
- Multiple workers per phase
- **Status**: COMPLETE
- Files updated:
  - MoveDevelopmentPrompts ✅
  - MoveCriticPrompts ✅
  - MoveRefinementPrompts ✅

### Phase II.4 (Detailed Outline Development) ✅
- Four-phase approach: framework integration → literature mapping → content development → structural validation
- Multiple workers and prompts
- **Status**: COMPLETE
- Files updated:
  - OutlineDevelopmentPrompts ✅
  - OutlineCriticPrompts ✅
  - OutlineRefinementPrompts ✅

### Phase II.5 (Currently Idle)
- Collaborator's stage
- May skip for now
- **Status**: SKIPPED

### Phase II.6 (Context Consolidation) ✅
- Python-based consolidation only (run_phase_2_6.py)
- No prompts to update - confirmed it's just scripting
- Consolidates outputs into writing context for Phase III
- **Status**: CONFIRMED NO PROMPTS

## Progress Summary

### Completed Mechanical Improvements:
- Phase II.1: 1 prompt class ✅
- Phase II.2: 9 prompt classes ✅
- Phase II.3: 3 prompt classes ✅
- Phase II.4: 3 prompt classes ✅
- **Total: 16 prompt classes updated** ✅

### What Was Done:
1. **Added system_prompt attribute** to all classes
   - Development: "You are an expert philosophy researcher..."
   - Critic: "You are a rigorous philosophy journal reviewer..."
   - Refinement: "You are an expert philosophy editor..."

2. **Added XML structure tags**
   - `<context>` - Pipeline awareness
   - `<task>` - Clear task description
   - `<requirements>` - Specific requirements
   - `<output_format>` - Expected output structure

3. **Added JSON formatting rules** where applicable

4. **Added pipeline context** to all prompts

5. **Added get_system_prompt() method** to all classes

## Next Steps

All mechanical improvements for Phase II are complete! The project is now ready for:
1. Testing the full pipeline with the improvements
2. Implementing sophisticated prompt patterns (like the "skeptical friend" approach)
3. Fine-tuning based on test results
