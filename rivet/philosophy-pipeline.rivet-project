This paper identifies and theorizes a distinct mechanism of epistemic harm: systematic epistemic overconfidence among privileged groups. Drawing on Patten's methodological framework for distinguishing epistemically accessible from inaccessible claims, the paper develops precise criteria for differentiating warranted from unwarranted expertise assertions. This analysis reveals how privileged epistemic overconfidence can systematically distort knowledge practices through mechanisms distinct from explicit bias or credibility deficit. While patterns of epistemic overconfidence correlate with social privilege, the paper's primary contribution is theoretical: establishing rigorous criteria for identifying epistemically unwarranted expertise claims as a unique form of epistemic harm. By adapting established methodological approaches to epistemic accessibility, the framework provides new analytical tools for understanding structural epistemic injustice, demonstrating how seemingly neutral knowledge practices can perpetuate epistemic harms through unwarranted claims to expertise.",
