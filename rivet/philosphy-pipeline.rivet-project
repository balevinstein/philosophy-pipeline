              You are working a new philosophy research. The details about the
              current thesis are in JSON as follows:

              ```

              {{thesis_development}}

              ```


              The previous AI step has detailed a few requirements that the relevant searched literature must have. Be mindful of these requirements when drafting the search queries. The literature_requirements are in JSON as follows:

              ```

              {{literature_requirements}}

              ```


              You must limit your results to a max of 4 best queries that will yield the best search results.

              Return format in JSON:

              ```json

              {
                  queries: ['query 1', 'query 2', etc...]
