# PR: Major Philosophy Pipeline Enhancements

## Summary
This PR implements comprehensive enhancements to the philosophy paper generation pipeline, focusing on philosophical rigor, Analysis journal style adherence, and systematic quality improvements. The changes significantly improve the pipeline's ability to generate publication-quality philosophy papers.

## Key Changes

### 1. üß† H√°jek Heuristics Integration
- Added systematic philosophical testing across all critic prompts
- Implemented extreme case testing, self-undermining detection, and counterexample generation
- Enhanced phases: II.1-4, III.1-2
- **Impact**: Critics now catch philosophical errors that would lead to desk rejection

### 2. üìö Philosophical Pattern Database
- Extracted 66 philosophical moves from 10 Analysis papers
- Created categorized database (offensive, defensive, constructive, meta)
- Injected patterns into Phase II.2, II.3, and II.4
- **Impact**: Papers now exhibit Analysis journal style and sophistication

### 3. üí™ Anti-RLHF "Take a Stand" Prompts
- Added philosophical courage instructions to all development workers
- Changed language from passive exploration to active argumentation
- **Impact**: Papers make bold claims and defend controversial positions

### 4. üêõ Critical Bug Fixes
- **Phase II.3**: Fixed hardcoded 2-move limit (now processes all 5 moves)
- **JSON Parsing**: Improved error handling and validation
- **PDF Integration**: End-to-end support for Analysis PDFs

### 5. üßπ Prompt Hygiene & Consistency
- Standardized XML tags across all prompts
- Fixed contradictory requirements (abstract length, quote counts)
- Added navigation aids for complex prompts
- **Impact**: More reliable pipeline, easier model comprehension

## Files Changed

### Core Pipeline Files
- `src/phases/phase_two/stages/stage_one/prompts.py`
- `src/phases/phase_two/stages/stage_two/prompts/abstract/*.py`
- `src/phases/phase_two/stages/stage_two/prompts/key_moves/*.py`

- `src/phases/phase_two/stages/stage_four/prompts/**/*.py`
- `src/phases/phase_two/stages/stage_three/workflows/master_workflow.py`

### New Documentation
- `docs/2024_12_enhancements_summary.md`
- `docs/extraction_tools_guide.md`
- `docs/PR_SUMMARY.md`
- Updated `docs/philosophy_pipeline_development_roadmap.md`

### New Tools & Scripts
- `extract_all_philosophical_moves.py`
- `curate_philosophical_moves.py`
- `validate_extraction_quality.py`
- `compare_hajek_improvements.py`

### Configuration
- Updated `.gitignore` for better log management

## Test Results

### Phase II.3 Before vs After
| Metric | Before | After |
|--------|--------|-------|
| Moves Processed | 2 | 5 |
| Voice | Passive exploration | Active argumentation |
| Examples | Clinical/neuroscience | Social/institutional |
| Literature Engagement | 3 sources | 12+ sources |
| Philosophical Rigor | Basic | Sophisticated |

### Quality Improvements
- ‚úÖ Bolder claims without excessive hedging
- ‚úÖ Better literature integration
- ‚úÖ Concrete examples that do argumentative work
- ‚úÖ Systematic objection handling
- ‚úÖ Analysis journal style adherence

## Breaking Changes
None - all changes are backwards compatible

## Migration Notes
- Existing papers can be regenerated to benefit from improvements
- No configuration changes required for basic operation

## Testing
- [x] Phase II.1 tested with new prompts
- [x] Phase II.2 tested with pattern injection
- [x] Phase II.3 tested with bug fix and full enhancements
- [x] Phase II.4 tested with comprehensive improvements
- [ ] Full end-to-end paper generation (pending)

## Next Steps
1. Temperature optimization through systematic hyperparameter sweep
2. Full paper generation with all enhancements
3. Referee simulation implementation
4. Dialectical development phase
