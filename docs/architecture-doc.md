   - Output: Newly developed content (frameworks, arguments, sections, papers)

2. **Critique Workers**: Evaluate content against quality criteria
   - Input: Developed content, evaluation criteria, quality standards
   - Output: Assessment (GOOD/MINOR_REFINEMENT/MAJOR_REFINEMENT) + specific recommendations

3. **Refinement Workers**: Implement improvements based on critique
   - Input: Original content, critique recommendations, refinement guidelines
   - Output: Refined content with documented changes

### Quality Control Principles

- **Clear Task Boundaries**: Each worker has specific, well-defined responsibilities
- **Managed Cognitive Load**: Context optimized for each worker type and stage
