# PDF Integration Bug Fix - Phase II.4

## Issue Resolved
**Problem**: Analysis PDFs were not being used in Phase II.4 detailed outline development, despite being properly integrated in Phase II.2 and II.3.

**Root Cause**: We enhanced `FrameworkIntegrationWorker` with PDF integration, but the master workflow (`DetailedOutlineDevelopmentWorkflow`) actually uses `OutlineDevelopmentWorker`.

## Solution Implemented
Enhanced `OutlineDevelopmentWorker` in `src/phases/phase_two/stages/stage_four/workers/planner/outline_development.py`:

1. **Added PDF Selection Method**: `_get_analysis_pdfs()` method for selecting Analysis papers
2. **Modified Run Method**: Enhanced to pass PDF paths to API handler when available
3. **Added PDF Storage**: `selected_analysis_pdfs` attribute to track selected PDFs

## Test Results âœ…
**Full Phase II.4 Test** (53.1 minutes):
- âœ… PDF integration working in all 4 phases
- âœ… Consistent PDF selection messages: `ðŸ“‘ Including 1 Analysis paper(s) for detailed_outline_development guidance: â€¢ anab039.pdf`
- âœ… All phases completed successfully: framework_integration, literature_mapping, content_development, structural_validation
- âœ… Proper Analysis journal pattern integration throughout workflow

## Code Changes
```python
# Added to OutlineDevelopmentWorker.__init__()
self.selected_analysis_pdfs = []

# Added PDF selection method
def _get_analysis_pdfs(self, pdf_count: int = 1) -> list:
    # PDF discovery and selection logic

# Enhanced run method with PDF support
if self.selected_analysis_pdfs:
    response = self.api_handler.make_api_call(
        stage=self.stage_name,
        prompt=prompt,
        pdf_paths=self.selected_analysis_pdfs
    )
```

## Impact
- Analysis journal patterns now properly integrated throughout Phase II.4
- Compound improvement strategy working as designed
- Ready for full pipeline testing with Analysis-aware development

## Status: âœ… FIXED AND VERIFIED
