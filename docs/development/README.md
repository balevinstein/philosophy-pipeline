## 🎯 Key Development Workflows

### Individual Stage Testing
Use the testing guide to run and validate individual pipeline stages during development.

### Prompt Engineering Cycle
1. Review existing philosophical patterns
2. Test prompt variations using extraction tools
3. Validate improvements using quality tracking template
4. Deploy to pipeline stages

### Quality Assessment
- Use quality tracking template for systematic evaluation
- Compare outputs before/after changes
- Document performance metrics and improvements

## 📚 Historical Context

These files were consolidated during the 2025 documentation restructure from various locations:
- Previous `docs/prompts/` directory
- Scattered development files
- Quality control resources

*⚠️ Some files may need updating to reflect current implementation.*
