# Pipeline Stages Documentation

*‚ö†Ô∏è DIRECTORY STATUS: Created during 2025 documentation restructure. Individual stage documents need creation.*

This directory contains detailed documentation for each phase of the philosophy paper generation pipeline.

## üìù Documentation Goals

Each stage document should include:
- **Purpose & Goals** - What this stage accomplishes
- **Input Requirements** - What files/data are needed
- **Process Overview** - High-level workflow
- **Worker Architecture** - Technical implementation details
- **Output Specifications** - What files are generated
- **Quality Control** - How quality is ensured
- **Performance Metrics** - Typical runtime and resource usage
- **Known Issues** - Current limitations or bugs
- **Future Enhancements** - Planned improvements

## üîß Implementation Notes

The detailed stage documentation should be created by:
1. **Reviewing actual implementation** in `src/phases/`
2. **Testing each stage individually** to verify behavior
3. **Documenting actual performance** metrics
4. **Identifying current limitations** through testing
5. **Cross-referencing with architecture** documentation

This approach ensures documentation reflects actual system behavior rather than intended design.
