    "abstract": "Testimonial knowledge acquisition presents unique challenges for anti-luck epistemology that remain insufficiently analyzed. Building on anti-luck virtue epistemology, this paper establishes a theoretically grounded distinction between transmission luck and content luck in testimony. Through systematic examination of paradigm cases, I demonstrate how these conceptually independent forms of epistemic luck require different safety conditions and virtue-theoretic treatments, while showing how they interact in practice through shared cognitive mechanisms. By examining cases where testimony fails to produce knowledge either through unreliable transmission processes or through accidentally true content, I develop criteria for distinguishing these luck types. This taxonomy illuminates why seemingly similar cases of testimonial knowledge acquisition can differ in epistemically significant ways, with implications for both theoretical understanding and practical assessment of testimonial knowledge claims.",

    "core_contribution": "The paper provides a theoretically grounded taxonomy of epistemic luck in testimony that demonstrates why and how transmission reliability and content truth require distinct treatments, extending anti-luck virtue epistemology through precise analysis of how these luck types manifest and interact in testimonial knowledge acquisition.",
