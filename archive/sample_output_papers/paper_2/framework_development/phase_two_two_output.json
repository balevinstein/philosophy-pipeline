    "abstract": "Testimonial knowledge acquisition presents unique challenges for anti-luck epistemology that remain insufficiently analyzed. Building on anti-luck virtue epistemology, this paper establishes a theoretically grounded distinction between transmission luck and content luck in testimony. Through systematic examination of paradigm cases, I demonstrate how these conceptually independent forms of epistemic luck require different safety conditions and virtue-theoretic treatments, while showing how they interact in practice through shared cognitive mechanisms. By examining cases where testimony fails to produce knowledge either through unreliable transmission processes or through accidentally true content, I develop criteria for distinguishing these luck types. This taxonomy illuminates why seemingly similar cases of testimonial knowledge acquisition can differ in epistemically significant ways, with implications for both theoretical understanding and practical assessment of testimonial knowledge claims.",
