# Scratch Work
Key interdependencies:
- Move 1 (Evaluative Criteria) provides foundation for all subsequent moves
- Move 2 (Historical Context) frames and motivates the framework
- Moves 3-4 (Application) depend on both criteria and context being established
- Need clear progression from theoretical foundation to practical implementation

# Move Analysis

## Move 1: Establish Explicit Evaluative Criteria

Argument Assessment:
- Strong basic structure linking Quinean insights to practical criteria
- Clear connection between meaning holism and evaluation approach
- Well-structured progression through different metric types
- Some gaps in justification of specific criteria choices

Development Feasibility:
+ Concrete metrics make development straightforward
+ Literature support available for key components
- May need tighter scope on corpus analysis component
- Success metric development could expand beyond space constraints

Literature Support:
+ Can leverage Chalmers/Jackson on application conditionals
+ Quine's holism helps frame criteria development
- Need stronger connection to Quinean concerns about meaning
+ Literature base supports core methodological moves

Integration:
+ Provides essential foundation for later moves
+ Clear connections to historical context
+ Supports practical application development
- May need stronger bridge to implementation

Recommendations:
1. Tighten scope of corpus analysis discussion
2. Strengthen justification for specific criteria choices
3. Develop explicit bridge to application section
4. Add more direct engagement with Quinean challenges

## Move 2: Historical Context

Argument Assessment:
+ Clear framing of key challenges
+ Strong connection to framework response
- Could strengthen connection between historical problems and current solutions
+ Good progression from problems to framework

Development Feasibility:
+ Manageable scope given space constraints
+ Clear development path
- May need tighter focus on most relevant historical elements
+ Reasonable literature requirements

Literature Support:
+ Strong foundation in Quine
+ Can use Chalmers/Jackson for response pattern
- Could strengthen connection to contemporary debates
+ Literature base covers core needs

Integration:
+ Sets up framework effectively
+ Links well to criteria development
+ Provides context for application
- Could strengthen connection to practical guidance

Recommendations:
1. Tighter focus on directly relevant historical elements
2. Strengthen connection to contemporary application
3. More explicit bridge to practical solutions
4. Consider condensing some historical detail

## Moves 3-4: Application

Argument Assessment:
+ Clear structure using application conditionals
+ Strong connection to evaluation criteria
+ Practical focus appropriate
- Could strengthen theoretical grounding

Development Feasibility:
+ Concrete steps make development straightforward
+ Clear implementation path
- May need to limit case study scope
+ Reasonable space requirements

Literature Support:
+ Can use Chalmers/Jackson application conditional framework
+ Theoretical foundation from earlier moves
- Could use more direct literature engagement
+ Core needs covered by available sources

Integration:
+ Builds effectively on earlier moves
+ Clear practical focus
- Could strengthen theoretical connections
+ Good progression from theory to practice

Recommendations:
1. Tighten case study scope
2. Strengthen theoretical connections
3. More explicit literature engagement
4. Clearer connection to evaluation criteria

# Cross-Cutting Considerations

Dependencies:
- Clear progression from theory to practice
- Each move builds effectively on previous ones
- Good balance between theoretical and practical elements

Literature Coverage:
- Strong engagement with core sources
- Could strengthen some contemporary connections
- Good use of available theoretical tools

Framework Support:
- Moves work together to support main thesis
- Clear development path from theory to application
- Good balance of components

# Summary Assessment
MINOR REFINEMENT

The key moves are fundamentally sound and work together effectively to advance the paper's thesis. Main needs are:
1. Tighter scoping of some components
2. Stronger theoretical connections in application section
3. More explicit literature engagement throughout
4. Clearer bridges between moves

Core structure is strong but needs targeted refinement to maximize effectiveness within space constraints while maintaining theoretical rigor.
