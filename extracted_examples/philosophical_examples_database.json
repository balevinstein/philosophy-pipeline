Imagine that nobody else is affected by this choice, and that there are no other potentially morally relevant differences at play: Adam and Eve are equally deserving, no impersonally valuable things are affected, and so on."

Same-Person Anonymity implies that A and C are equally good. Transitivity then implies that A is better than B, in line with the Non-Identity Principle. If we want to reject this instance of the Non-Identity Principle, it thus looks like we have to say that C is not better than B, despite appearances. But compare B and C directly. We can imagine going from C to B by making two changes. First, we make Adam worse off by twenty units of wellbeing. Second, we replace Steve with the worse-off Eve.</text>"

In the second future, the present inhabitants will instead have 60 units of wellbeing, while seven billion future individuals, who are non-identical to the individuals existing in the first future, will have only 40 units of wellbeing. If we suppose that it does not make the world better to replace any number of lives at level 40 by the same number of lives at level 80, an argument exactly analogous to that of the preceding paragraph shows that, given Same-Person Anonymity and Transitivity, the second future is not worse than the first."

Suppose that the predictor perfectly predicts that ball number 13 will not be drawn. Does the objective risk nevertheless harm Adam? Since it is perfectly predicted that the risk is 'impotent', the risk's impact on Adam's interests is the same as pointing a certainly empty gun at Adam and pulling the trigger."

By forcing me to engage in an immoral joint action, the criminal disrespects me in such a fundamental way that if the gun turns out to be fake, I have of course no obligations towards this person to notify or to seek permission to leave."
